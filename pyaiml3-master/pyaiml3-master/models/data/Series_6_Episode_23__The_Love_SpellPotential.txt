Penny: No.
Amy: So there are some rules.
Bernadette: Fine. No husbands, no boyfriends, some rules.
Amy: Thank you. Vegas!
Scene: The apartment. 
Howard: The ladies are away, the boys will play.
Raj: Anything can happen.
Leonard: Its gonna get crazy.
Sheldon: Dungeons & Dragons.
Scene: The taxi. 
Penny: I got a brand-new bikini, so drinks at the pool are on these.
Bernadette: I got a sexy new tube top that says come hither, and a can of pepper spray that says close enough, Jack.
Amy: I got some old underwear Im gonna throw on stage at the Garth Brooks concert.
Penny: Im sorry, why old?
Amy: Cause last time I saw him, I threw new ones and it got me nothing.
Scene: The apartment. 
Sheldon: Ive got a brand-new seven piece set of polyhedral dice. Hello, new dice smell.
Leonard: Ive got my helm of lordly might, my boots of speed, and if things get too exciting, my inhaler of asthma.
Raj: I got my new bloodthirsty savage warrior who will lay waste to all who stand before him. And I had a sensible salad for lunch, so I can eat all the pizza I want.
Howard: Come on, are we gonna sit around chatting like a bunch of teenage girls, or are we gonna play D&D like a bunch of teenage boys who are never gonna have sex with those teenage girls?
Scene: The taxi. 
Girls: Vegas! Vegas! Vegas!
Scene: The apartment.

Credits sequence. 
Scene: The apartment.
Raj: Im actually glad Lucy had to work tonight. Saved me the awkward conversation about how I was gonna be hanging with my bros.
Howard: Isnt every conversation you two have awkward?
Raj: Painfully so. We have this rule on the phone that if no one talks for three minutes, you can just hang up. So into her.
Howard: Ready whenever you guys are.
Sheldon: Yeah, yeah, well be right there. Leonard?
Leonard: Yeah?
Sheldon: Im not sure how I feel about Howard being dungeon master instead of you.
Leonard: Oh, thats nice. But relax, sometimes change is good. Uh, you were worried about Zachary Quinto being the new Spock, but you wound up liking him.
Sheldon: Oh, please. Every time the topic of change comes up, you throw Zachary Quinto in my face. Im upset the mailman has a new haircut, Zachary Quinto. Im upset that daylight saving time started, Zachary Quinto. Im upset daylight saving time ended, Zachary Quinto. Im saying this for the last time, Zachary Quinto was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event. So stop using him against me.
Howard: Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in an overgrown old forest. Before you is a giant oak tree with a face on it that looks a lot like Nicolas Cage. He says, (Nicolas Cage voice) Travel with caution. These woods are home to the bones of many a fallen hero.
Leonard: See, Howards just as good a dungeon master as I am.
Sheldon: As good? You just got pantsed in the schoolyard, four-eyes.
Raj: Hey, come on, guys, focus. Um, uh, oh, mighty Nicolas Cage tree, we thank you for your warning, but we are brave warriors, and nothing short of death will keep us from our goal. (Text sound) Oh, Lucys free after all. See ya.
Leonard: Hey, hey, hey, you cant leave. We just started.
Raj: Youre right, I should finish the game. I take my plus-one long sword, stab myself in the face with it. Im dead, Ive got a date with a girl. Bye.
Howard: Well be fine, watch. Suddenly, a spectral shape rises from Koothrappalis bloody corpse, and says, (Raj voice) dont worry, buddies, ghost Raj will help guide you through the forest. (Nicolas Cage voice) Well, Im just a tree, but if I were you, Id listen to your ghost friend.
Sheldon: Go on, give him your lunch money.
Scene: A restaurant
Raj: Im very happy you were able to hang out tonight.
Lucy: Me, too.
Raj: Not that its up to you to make me happy. Uh, well, unless you find neediness sexy. In which case, youre about to have dinner with the hottest man on the planet.
Lucy: Can I tell you something? I was so nervous about seeing you, before I left my apartment, I put roll-on antiperspirant all over my body.
Raj: Really?
Lucy: Yeah. If sweat starts squirting out the top of my head, youll know why.
Raj: I, uh, Im sorry to put you through that.
Lucy: Oh, its okay. Ive been trying to force myself to do things that make me scared.
Raj: What else have you been thinking about doing?
Lucy: Well, lets see. Id love to be able to tell the lady who cuts my hair that I dont like bangs.
Raj: I like your bangs.
Lucy: Oh, thanks, I like em, too.
Raj: What else?
Lucy: Mmm, its kind of a tie between sending food back in a restaurant and saying no to those kids who sell magazines door-to-door.
Raj: Mm, yeah. Those are both toughies.
Lucy: I know. I have a two-year subscription to Guns & Ammo.53
Scene: The apartment.
Leonard: I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way.
Howard: Uh, it does. (Creaking sound)
Sheldon: He does sound effects, too!
Leonard: Hey, I always did sound effects. A-A swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon. (Clicking sounds) Uh, uh, they attack a nearby unicorn. (Strange howl)
Sheldon: Okay, well, I have a sound effect for those sound effects. (Blows raspberry)
Penny: Guess who?
Howard: What are you doing back?
Bernadette: Thats an excellent question. Amy?
Amy: Uh, well, when we were going through security, I got pulled out of line for a pat-down. The, uh, TSA agent got a little handsy. I may have broken her nose with my elbow.
Bernadette: Long story short, shes on the No Fly List and we might have been followed here by a drone.
Amy: Im sorry. I feel like such an idiot.
Penny: Oh, its not so bad. You lost money, youre filled with shame and you got groped by a stranger. I mean, thats Vegas, you nailed it.
Amy: You guys enjoy your evening. Im gonna go before I ruin anybody elses weekend.
Sheldon: Ah, thats my girl.
Leonard: No, no, no, Amy, wait. I know its not the night you had in mind, but why dont you guys stay and play with us? Itll be fun.
Sheldon: It would? Fun? Okay, three weeks ago you bought crunchy peanut butter, now you want the girls to play D&D? Do you have a drug problem?
Leonard: Whats the big deal? Raj bailed, so we could use some extra players.
Sheldon: Well, Ive just never played Dungeons & Dragons with girls before.
Penny: Oh, dont worry, sweetie. No one has.
Leonard: So, what do you say?
Sheldon: Ill leave it up to the dungeon master.
Howard: A satanic fungus that looks suspiciously like Al Pacino rises from the forest floor and says, (Al Pacino voice) Youre playing D&D. Youre playing D&D. This whole apartment is playing D&D.
Scene: Later, the same.
Penny: Okay, who wants a drink?
Sheldon: Yeah, we, now, Penny, we dont consume alcohol during Dungeons & Dragons. It impairs our judgment.
Penny: Oh, this isnt alcohol. Its a magic potion that makes me like you.
Leonard: Double potion, please.
Howard: Okay, here we go. You find yourselves face-to-face with two hulking ogres. What are you doing in our dungeon? You shall die!
Sheldon: Okay, literal goose bumps. Look.
Howard: What do you do?
Leonard: I draw my broadsword.
Sheldon: I ready my quarter-staff.
Penny: I drink my potion.
Bernadette: I say we attack the big one.
Penny: You know what? Give me the dice, I want to roll.
Howard: The dungeon masters supposed to roll.
Penny: Yeah, well Im supposed to be in Vegas throwing up on a shrimp buffet. Now give it. All right, what do I need?
Howard: Uh, fifteen or higher.
Penny: Fifteens the point, the point is fifteen. Give the little lady some room, here it is, coming out. Sixteen! Yes! Oh, please tell me were playing for money.
Sheldon: Oh, even better than money. You gained experience points.
Penny: More potion, please.
Leonard: Yeah.
Scene: The restaurant.
Raj: How are your crab cakes?
Lucy: Kind of funky.
Raj: Thats great.
Lucy: It is? Does funky mean something different in India?
Raj: No, no. Uh, youve always wanted to send your food back in a restaurant, heres your chance.
Lucy: Mmm, its okay. I just wont eat em.
Raj: Dont be ridiculous. Waiter?
Waiter: Everything all right?
Lucy: Uh, yeah. Everything all right with you?
Waiter: Yes.
Lucy: Kay, thanks, bye.
Raj: Hold on. Isnt there something else you wanted to tell him?
Lucy: N-No, it, its fine. Uh, Hes from a different country, he doesnt understand our ways.
Raj: Dont be silly. Just tell him.
Lucy: I have to go to the bathroom. And its not because the crab cakes are funky.
Waiter: So youre okay here?
Raj: Uh, yeah, sorry. Shes just a little shy. The first time we met, she was so nervous, she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me.
Scene: Lucy climbs out of bathroom window to find a locked gate.
Lucy: Uh-oh. (Dials phone) Hey, Raj. Funny story.
Scene: The apartment.
Bernadette: Come on, mama wants a pair of dead ogres.
Howard: Seventeen, the larger ogre is dead. The-the other ogre says, you killed my brother, now Ogre Thanksgiving is ruined.
Sheldon: That is amazing. He made me care about the ogre.
Leonard: All right, Amy, theres one ogre left. Take him out.
Amy: Okay.
Penny: Pretend hes that TSA agent. Come on.
Amy: Nineteen. Yes, this is turning out to be even better than Vegas.
Penny: No, its not.
Scene: An alley behind the restaurant.
Raj: Lucy?
Lucy: Hey. Long time no see.
Raj: You dont know me very well, but each time you crawl out a bathroom window to escape my company, it chips away at my masculinity.
Lucy: Im sorry.
Raj: Why would you leave like that?
Lucy: You were pushing me. I clearly didnt want to send my food back, and you tried to make me do it anyway.
Raj: Okay, if I upset you, then why didnt you just say something?
Lucy: Well, how can I tell you Im upset if I cant tell the woman at Supercuts that my foreheads my best feature? Its scary.
Raj: Yeah, well, I like you a lot, and thats scary for me. Mostly because youre a proven flight risk.
Lucy: How could you like me a lot?
Raj: Well, uh, for one thing, you have bigger emotional problems than I do, and I find that very attractive in a woman. I, I dont know. I just, I think youre wonderful.
Lucy: Im sweating out of my head.
Scene: The apartment. 
Howard: The dragon falls from the sky, crashing into the volcano.
Sheldon: Yay!
Howard: But wait., hes not dead. He crawls out, spreads his wings and prepares to attack.
Sheldon: Yeah, uh, wait. Doesnt he say something first? You know, maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?
Howard: Fine. (Christopher Walken voice) Youd think, after all these years, Id know not to fly over volcanoes. Im a freaking idiot.
Sheldon: The dragons Christopher Walken. Thats perfect.
Leonard: All right, Amy, its your turn. We need one more hit. Finish him off.
Amy: Here we go. Fifteen?
Howard: Its a hit. The dragon collapses to the ground.
Sheldon: Wait. Wait. And says?
Howard: Mother? Is that you? Your little boy is coming home.
Sheldon: Oh, I dont know about you guys, but I have been through the emotional wringer tonight.
Bernadette: This may be the potion talking, but you are one fine-ass dungeon master.
Howard: Oh, yeah? Well, when we get home, Im gonna take you on a whole different adventure.
Sheldon: Another quest by Wolowitz? Count me in.
Amy: Sheldon, theyre talking about sex.
Sheldon: Oh, then Im out.
Penny: Ooh, I have an idea. Since its not happening any time soon, why dont your character and your character do it in the game?
Bernadette: Ooh! Come on, back me up here.
Howard: Oh.
Together: Ooh!
Bernadette: Okay, I cast a love spell on Sheldon and Amy.
Leonard: Ooh! Sorry, I thought you were gonna do that.
Howard: The love spell takes effect. When Sheldon looks at Amy, she is the most beautiful half-orc hes ever seen, and hes overcome with a desire to rip her armour off and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts. When Amy sees Sheldon, he looks, well, just like Sheldon, cause apparently shes into that. What do you do?
Amy: I dont like this.
Sheldon: You see what happens when you let girls play D&D?
Scene: Sheldons bedroom. 
Sheldon (off): (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy.
Amy: What?
Sheldon: Ive never knocked on my own door before. That was a wild ride.
Amy: You dont have to come in here and cheer me up.
Sheldon: Thank you. Would you go tell everyone else that? Because they sure think otherwise.
Amy: Ill tell you what they think. They think our relationship is a joke.
Sheldon: Well, I dont think our relationship is a joke. I think a horse goes into a bar, bartender says, why the long face?, thats a joke. Its a good one, too, because a horse has a long face.
Amy: Sheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?
Sheldon: Oh, my. Thats an uncomfortable topic. Amy, before I met you, I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone.
Amy: And now?
Sheldon: And now what?
Amy: Do you have any interest now?
Sheldon: I have not ruled it out.
Amy: Wow. Talk dirty to me.
Sheldon: I know it doesnt seem like it to you, but, for me, what we have is extremely intimate.
Amy: I guess I know that. Its just, part of me wants more.
Sheldon: More? I mean, look at us. Its only been three years, here we are in bed together.
Amy: Come on. Lets go back out there.
Sheldon: Well, no. Hold on. My Elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them. We wouldnt really be playing the game right if we didnt see that through.
Amy: Okay.
Sheldon: I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon. While the others pillage the corpse, I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armour. (Rolls dice) It comes off.
Amy: Oh.
Sheldon: What do you do?
Amy: I kiss you on the lips.
Sheldon: I kiss you back on the (Rolls dice) lips as well. Your turn.
Amy: I remove your armour. What do you do?
Sheldon: I erotically caress your (Rolls dice) nose.
Amy: Keep rolling.
Scene: Outside Sheldons bedroom.
Leonard: Hey, you guys have been in there for a while. You doing okay?
Sheldon (off): Were fine, thank you.
Penny: Okay, we just want to say, we feel really bad about
Amy: Go away! Sheldon is nibbling on my (sound of dice) 14! Yes!
