Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is stood in the middle of the room. His whiteboard is behind him. Every few moments he turns round suddently.
Penny: Whatcha doing?
Sheldon: Im attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.
Penny: Interesting. I usually just have coffee. Youve been up all night?
Sheldon: Is it morning?
Penny: Yes.
Sheldon: Then Ive been up all night.
Penny: And youre stuck?
Sheldon: Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?
Penny: Oh, sorry, sweetie, I cant help you till Ive had my coffee.
Leonard: Penny, I told you if you dont put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment.
Penny: What is he doing now?
Leonard: Mmm, hes either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off.
Sheldon: Captain Hooks hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator. If youre going to mock me, at least get your facts straight.
Leonard: Aye, aye, Captain.
Sheldon: I cant see it! It just wont coalesce.
Leonard: Maybe you need a fresh start.
Sheldon: Youre right. (Takes whiteboard to window and throws it out. Picks up a new one) Its a great idea, Leonard. Thank you.
Credits sequence. 
Scene: The cafeteria.
Sheldon: Electrons move through graphene, act as if they have no mass
Howard: How long has he been stuck?
Leonard: Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29 years.
Sheldon: Unit cell contains two carbon atoms. Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.
Howard: Have you tried rebooting him?
Leonard: No, I think its a firmware problem.
Raj (arriving): Hey, its Disco Night at the Moonlight Roller Rink in Glendale tonight. Whos up for getting down?
Howard: Oh, thats perfect. Bernadettes been hocking me to take her roller skating.
Leonard: I think Penny likes to skate. The four of us could double.
Howard: What could be better? Were in.
Raj: Great. Its not like I brought it up because I wanted to go.
Howard: You can come with us.
Raj: No, its okay. I dont have to go. Im happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. Im a walking brown Yelp.com.
Sheldon: Structure, constant structure. One atom
Howard: Boy, hes really gone, isnt he?
Leonard: Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant.
Howard: I thought I smelled popcorn.
Sheldon: Pattern is the same as fermions, travels on the pathways, hexagonal, its always hexagonal
Leonard: I havent seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.
Raj (as Sheldon reaches out and grabs from his plate): Hey, those are my lima beans!
Sheldon: Not lima beans, carbon atoms.
Raj: But if I dont eat my lima beans, I cant have my cookie.
Leonard: Here, you want my peas?
Sheldon: Peas! Perfect, they can be electrons.
Howard: Want my corn?
Sheldon: Dont be ridiculous. What would I do with corn?
Leonard: So roller skating, should we all grab a bite to eat first?
Howard: Good. P.F. Changs? My mom has coupons.
Leonard: Great. Your moms not coming, right?
Howard: Not this time, I promise.
Raj: Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and Im very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes.
Sheldon: The plural of coccyx is coccyges.
Raj: Screw you. Give me back my lima beans.
Scene: The stairwell.
Bernadette: Oh, my God, have you ever been so embarrassed?
Penny: Not recently.
Bernadette: I dont know which was lamer, their roller-skating or their disco dancing.
Penny: For me, the worst part was when people saw us leave with them.
Leonard: You had some nice moves out there, Howard.
Howard: Thanks. You, too.
Leonard: Yeah. Did you notice all the people looking at us?
Howard: Not really. I was in my boogie zone.
Bernadette: When Howard tried to do the splits
Penny: Shh.
Leonard: Sorry. Im moving a little slow. I think I bruised my coccyx.
Penny: Oh, poor baby.
Leonard: Dont tell Koothrappali. After you.
Penny: Oh, what a gentleman. Hey, Sheldon. (Steps on marbles which are all over the floor, screams and falls)
Leonard: Oh, my God! Are you (falls as well)
Sheldon: Good Lord! Youre ruining everything!
Penny: Oh, damn.
Leonard: Are you okay?
Penny: Do I look okay?
Leonard: Dont bark at me. I fell, too.
Penny: Oh, youve been falling all night. Youre used to it.
Howard: Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?
Sheldon: The same thing Ive been doing for three days. Trying to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass when travelling through a graphene sheet.
Bernadette: With marbles?
Sheldon: Well, I needed something bigger than peas, now, didnt I?
Bernadette: Sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?
Sheldon: I dont know, two, three days. Not important. I dont need sleep, I need answers. I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth.
Penny: Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?
Leonard: No, thats a crazy thing.
Bernadette: Okay, Sheldon. What happens to our neuroreceptors when we dont get enough REM sleep?
Sheldon: They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.
Bernadette: Which leads to?
Sheldon: Impaired cognitive function.
Bernadette: Right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed.
Sheldon: But I dont want to go to bed.
Bernadette: Im going to count to three. One
Sheldon: Oh, all right.
Leonard: That was amazing how you handled him.
Bernadette: I know how to deal with stubborn children. My mother used to run an illegal day care centre in our basement.
Scene: Leonards bedroom.
 
Penny: Leonard, youre youre giggling in your sleep.
Leonard: Its not me, its my new ringtone. The Joker from Batman.
Penny: Well, it creeps me out.
Leonard: Me, too, but I paid three bucks for it.
Penny: Just answer the phone.
Leonard: Hello. Yeah, Im Leonard Hofstadter. Yeah, yeah, hes my roommate. Oh, God, is he okay? Yeah, alright, alright, Ill be right there.
Penny: What happened?
Leonard: Sheldons escaped and is terrorizing the village.
Penny: Okay. Have fun.
Scene: A childrens play area.
Leonard: Hi. Im Dr. Hofstadter. Where is he?
Security Guard: Ball pit.
Leonard: Thanks for not calling the cops.
Security Guard: Oh, hey, its no big deal. My sisters got a kid whos special.
Leonard: Yeah, well, hes extra special. Hey, Shelly. What you doing?
Sheldon: Size ratio was all wrong. Couldnt visualize it. Needed bigger carbon atoms.
Leonard: Sure, sure. How did you get into this place?
Sheldon: Back door has a five-pin tumbler system, single-circuit alarm. Childs play. You can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms.
Leonard: No, I dont think so. We need to go home now.
Sheldon: But Im still working.
Leonard: If you dont come out of there, Im going to have to drag you out.
Sheldon: You can try, but youll never catch me. (He disappears under the balls)
Leonard: For Gods sakes. Sheldon, come here!
Sheldon (popping his head up): Bazinga. (Disappears, pops up in another place) Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga.
Scene: Leonards bedroom. Sheldon is standing over their bed. He knocks on the wall. 
 
Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.
Leonard (Waking up as Penny screams): What! What, what, what?
Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. 
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: I have good news.
Leonard: And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?
Sheldon: Your cell phone was off.
Leonard: Because we didnt want to be disturbed.
Sheldon: And that didnt work out, did it?
Penny: Sheldon, what do you want?
Sheldon: I came to tell you Ive got the answer.
Leonard: Really? You figured out the graphene problem?
Sheldon: No, no, Im still hopelessly stuck on that, but I figured out how to figure it out.
Penny: Hey, you know what, Leonard, I know I said I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong. Were going to have to break up.
Leonard: What are you talking about?
Penny (as Sheldon sits on the bed): Oh.
Sheldon: Einstein.
Leonard: Yeah, Im going to need a little more.
Sheldon: Albert Einstein.
Leonard: Keep going.
Sheldon: When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity, he was working at the patent office.
Leonard: So, youre going to go work at the patent office?
Sheldon: Dont be absurd. Thats in Washington. You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. No. Im going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem.
Leonard: Sounds like a great plan.
Sheldon: Of course it is. Even talking to you is sufficiently menial that I can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow.
Leonard: Okay, well, thanks for sharing with us. Good night.
Sheldon: Youre welcome. Good night to you, too. Oh, by the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment, and I noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when youre on your back.
Penny: Leonard doesnt snore.
Sheldon: No, I wasnt talking to Leonard.
Leonard: Told you.
Scene: An employment office
Employment Office Assistant: So, Mr. Cooper, youre looking for a job.
Sheldon: A menial job. Like yours.
Assistant: Why, thank you for noticing. Im Menial Employee of the Month. Do you have a particular field in mind?
Sheldon: I do. For thousands of years, the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. Do you have anything like that?
Assistant: No.
Sheldon: Shouldnt you check your database?
Assistant (clicks her keyboard a few times): No.
Sheldon: You didnt really type.
Assistant: I didnt really have to. So, how about construction?
Sheldon: Oh, that would be good! Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis.
Assistant: No, no. This is putting up sheetrock at a housing project in Rosemead.
Sheldon: I could do that.
Assistant: Good.
Sheldon: One question.
Assistant: Yes?
Sheldon: Whats sheetrock?
Assistant: Moving on. How about doing deliveries for a florist?
Sheldon: That seems acceptable.
Assistant: Do you have your own car?
Sheldon: I dont drive.
Assistant: Of course you dont. Mr. Cooper, let me just ask you a question. What was your last job?
Sheldon: Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech, focusing on M theory, or, in laymans terms, string theory.
Assistant: I see. Just give me a second. Security!
Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.
Penny: Okay, Ill get those drinks started for you.
Sheldon (appearing in an apron and carrying a tray): Behind you.
Penny: Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?
Sheldon: Im trying to get these tables cleared. Were slammed.
Penny: No, wait, wait, no, wait. Wh.. what are you doing here?
Sheldon: A reasonable question. I asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an Apple Store genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I dont like touching other peoples coins, and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here I am.
Penny: You just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?
Sheldon: Oh, heavens, no. Since I dont need to be paid, I didnt need to be hired. I simply came in, picked up a tray, and started working for the man. Let me get that plate out of your way.
Penny: Sheldon, this is ridiculous.
Sheldon: Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.
Bernadette: Thanks, Sheldon.
Penny: Sheldon, wait, this isnt even what I do. Im a waitress, not a busboy.
Sheldon: Youre right. That is more menial. Hello, Im Sheldon. Ill be your server today. I dont recommend the salmon. I saw it in the kitchen.
Scene: The same, later.
Sheldon: All right, one bacon cheeseburger, breaking two Jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously, kudos. Beer-battered fish and chips. Now, heres your tartar sauce. I also brought you salsa. Its a little unconventional, but I think youll like it. Its zingy. And for you, Factory Burrito Grande, no cheese, no sour cream, no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance. Bon apptit.
Leonard: Hang on. Black beans, not pinto beans?
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: Double guacamole?
Sheldon: Of course.
Leonard: No cilantro?
Sheldon: Nope.
Leonard: Lettuce shredded, not chopped?
Sheldon: Yep.
Leonard: You understand why Im doing this to you?
Sheldon: I do.
Leonard: Thatll be all. That was fun.
Raj: How long can he keep this up?
Leonard: I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer.
Raj: He never went back to the university?
Leonard: Only to shampoo Professor Chambourgs shih tzu.
Raj: Sheesh.
Howard: I bet if we all chipped in, we could buy Sheldon a van.
Raj: But hes afraid of dogs.
Leonard: Yeah, thats the only thing wrong with that plan.
Penny: Hey, guys, sorry you had to wait, but we are swamped. Whats this?
Leonard: Sheldon took our order.
Penny: Sheldon doesnt work here.
Leonard: Well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to think you didnt either.
Sheldon (drops tray. A nearby table claps): Is that really necessary? Good Lord. The interference pattern in the fracture. The motion of the wave through the molecular structure. Ive been looking at it all wrong. I cant consider the electrons as particles. They move through the graphene as a wave. Its a wave! The moment to applaud would be now. Troglodytes.
Penny: Sheldon, where are you going? Arent you going to clean this up?
Sheldon: Im sorry. I dont work here.
Scene: The roller disco. 
Howard: Happy now?
Raj: Im on a cloud. Swing me. (Howard swings Raj several times.)
Scene: The ball pit, presumably earlier. 
Leonard: Sheldon, come here.
(Sheldon once again keeps popping up his head and shouting Bazinga as Leonard flails around trying to catch him.)
