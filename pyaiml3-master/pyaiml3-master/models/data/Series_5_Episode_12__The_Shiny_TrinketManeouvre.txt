Scene: The apartment.
Howard: Completely empty box. If youd like to examine it?
Leonard: Mm-hmm. Yep. I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.
Howard: Little snarky there, cello lessons. And we have this completely ordinary cylinder. If youd like to examine it?
Raj: Ordinary, yet I sense it is dripping with magical potential.
Sheldon: Oh, dear Lord. A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader, only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret.
Leonard: Sheldon, hes just practising for his cousins birthday party.
Howard: As I was saying, empty box, empty cylinder, and, ooh, voila. (Pulls out a goldfish in a jar)
Raj: Im telling you, dude, theres a seat on the Hogwarts Express with your name on it.
Sheldon: This is how youre going to entertain your little cousin and his friends? By lying to them?
Howard: How is this lying?
Sheldon: A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. This is an ordinary top hat. Youve chosen that card freely. I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister.
Raj: Cant you just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon? Why must you peek behind the curtain? Or up the butt?
Sheldon: If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats, then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice for Green Lantern than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion.
Leonard: Sheldon, hes just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids. I really dont think theyre gonna end up liking the Green Lantern movie.
Howard: Dont be so hard on him. Its natural to be a little cranky when you have a quarter in your ear!
Sheldon: Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement. When I was five, Billy Sparks put a Mexican peso up my nose.
Howard: How is that not amusing?
Sheldon: Its still there. Takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security. (Storms out)
Howard: Look, I made Sheldon disappear. Ta-da.
Leonard: Next time, you should open with that.
Credits sequence.
Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.
Penny: Ooh, look whos out on a date. Pasadenas favourite power couple, Shamy.
Sheldon: And that is the answer to the question, what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory?
Penny: So, are we celebrating anything special tonight?
Amy: Oh, yes. Our relationship agreement specifies that the second Thursday of every month, or the third Thursday in a month with five Thursdays, is date night.
Penny: That is so hot.
Sheldon: All right, without objection, the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to. Any new business?
Amy: How was your day?
Sheldon: Superb. This morning I made a palindrome with my Alpha-Bits. Nice hat, Bob Tahecin.
Amy: Sounds like you hit the ground running. I have a bit of good news myself. My most recent paper on how a cooperative long-term potentiation can map memory sequences in dendritic branches made the cover of Neuron.
Sheldon: Ooh! Speaking of good news, somebody just hit 100 Twitter followers.
Amy: Thats nice. Anyway, Ive been dreaming of this day for a long time.
Sheldon: Yeah, me, too. Triple digits, Im not gonna lie, feels pretty good.
Amy: Sheldon, Im the sole author on a paper being published in a distinguished journal that may change the course of my field.
Sheldon: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ooh, 101! Airs getting a bit thin up here.
Penny: So, are we ready to order?
Amy: Give me a minute. Im gonna go wash up.
Sheldon: Well, thats odd. We both washed up when we came in. Its probably a euphemism for urination.
Penny: Sheldon, what is wrong with you?
Sheldon: Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. I dont know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside.
Penny: Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal.
Sheldon: Oh, I see why youre confused. No, her news sounded important, but what youre forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. Thats all about yucky, squishy things.
Penny: Honey, shes upset. Youre her boyfriend. You have to at least try to be excited by the things shes excited by.
Sheldon: What if they simply dont excite me?
Penny: Well, just smile and think about koalas.
Sheldon: Shed see right through that. We go to the zoo all the time. She knows my koala face. And for future reference, its this.
Scene: Howards bedroom.
Bernadette: Oh, you have a lot of magic stuff.
Howard: Yeah. I started when I was a teenager. I thought I could show a girl a few tricks and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act.
Bernadette: Did it work?
Howard: Ah, lets just say the only wand that ever saw any action was this one. Oh, look what my mom made us for the act.
Bernadette: Ooh. I like the fabric. Whered she get it?
Howard: Well, she cut up one of her old bathing suits. She made these two vests and half a dozen napkins.
Mrs Wolowitz (off): Has she tried on the vest yet?
Howard: I just gave it to her!
Mrs Wolowitz (off): I hope it fits, she has a tricky figure! Shes short and stacked, like me!
Howard: Shes not stacked like you, Ma! She never steps on hers!
Bernadette: Listen, Howie, maybe Im not the best choice to be a magicians assistant.
Howard: Youll do fine. Hand me those rings? See? You nailed it.
Bernadette: You know, i-its just that Im not that comfortable with little kids.
Howard: Well, thats because you havent been around them much. This is good practice. I mean, you are gonna be a mom someday, right?
Bernadette: Mmm, yeah, sure.
Howard: Oh-ho-ho! I havent seen this trick in years. Its called the dove pan. You let everyone see the pan is empty, but theres a secret compartment in the lid. And then you open it and produce a live Dont look in there.
Scene: The apartment.
Leonard: Oh, a little Red Dead Redemption, huh?
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: How come youre not doing a mission? Youre just wandering around.
Sheldon: Had a rough night. I thought Id go for a walk and clear my head.
Leonard: Some people go outside and do that.
Sheldon: Its after nine oclock, at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats.
Leonard: You want to talk about it?
Sheldon: No. I think Ill just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away.
Leonard: You know digital alcohol is never a solution. Whats going on?
Sheldon: Hard as this may be to believe, its possible that Im not boyfriend material.
Leonard: Glad I was sitting down for that. Did you and Amy get in a fight?
Sheldon: Amy had a fight. I was being perfectly reasonable. Im gonna have a whiskey. Do you want anything?
Leonard: No, I cant. Im playing Grand Theft Auto later. Look, Im no expert in women.
Sheldon: Ill say.
Leonard: Thats not necessary when someones trying to help you.
Sheldon: Im sorry. Its the alcohol talking. Go on.
Leonard: Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.
Sheldon: Nuts to that. What else you got?
Leonard: I dont know what to tell you. Buy her something.
Sheldon: How does that work?
Leonard: Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture.
Sheldon: Well, that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it.
Leonard: Glad I could help.
Sheldon: Its appreciated. And if you ever manage to find a woman again, Ill be glad to return the favour.
Scene: The birthday party.
Howard: And now, all the rings are magically linked together. My fiancees wearing a magic ring, too. It made all my money disappear.
Bernadette: Oh, ah, right. (Bangs drum and cymbal) And now, the great Howdinis next miraculous illusion.
Child: When are we gonna have cake?
Bernadette: After youve been thoroughly amazed.
Child: But we want cake now.
Bernadette: Well, youre not getting cake right now, capisce?
Howard: Okay. Okay. Now, my lovely assistant is going to bring me an ordinary pitcher of milk.
Second child: I know how you do that trick.
Bernadette: Do you know how to pipe down?
Howard: Okay, were going to roll up this newspaper.
Second child: Its a fake pitcher.
Bernadette: You got wax in your ears? The man said its an ordinary pitcher. Howdini.
Howard: Okay, were going to stick this in here (puts newspaper into trouser waistband) and then Im going to pour in the milk. I hope this works, because I didnt bring a change of pants.
Second child: Look, I Googled it. Its a fake pitcher.
Bernadette: Thats it. No cake for you. Anyone else want to join the No Cake Club?
Howard: Shes just kidding, boys and girls. Everyone gets cake.
Bernadette: Not him.
Howard: Just give me the pitcher. Behold! Wrong pitcher.
Scene: Bernadettes car.
Bernadette: I told you Im not good with kids.
Howard: Yes, you did. Oh, I think my crotch is starting to curdle.
Bernadette: The thing is, my mother worked full-time. I had to take care of my brothers and sisters.
Howard: Yeah, so?
Bernadette: Ugh, it was horrible. With their snotty noses and their poopy diapers and their little shrieky voices, always complaining. I dont want to get dressed. Joey keeps spitting in my mouth. This isnt the way Mom makes waffles. Well, okay, put your hand in here. Lets see how you like this waffle!
Howard: All right, settle down. Red light. Red light, red light! Okay, were fine.
Bernadette: Im sorry. I know it makes me sound like a bad person, but I just dont like children.
Howard: Yeah, no, we all got that. But dont you think itll be different when the child is ours?
Bernadette: Right, when its our kid thats ruined my body and kept me up all night and Ive got no career and no future and nothing to be happy about for the next 20 years, sure, thatll be completely different.
Howard: Well, yeah.
Scene: A jewellery store.
Sheldon: I dont think theres anything in this jewellery store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears.
Penny: Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you when I say stupid stuff.
Sheldon: Ooh, a pocket watch.
Penny: Okay, I dont think Amy wants a pocket watch.
Sheldon: No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch.
Penny: Still saying stupid stuff. Ooh, does she like bracelets?
Sheldon: Well, shes very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin. Maybe they have a dressier version of that?
Assistant: Well, how are we doing this afternoon? Are we looking for anything special? Perhaps a ring for the lady?
Penny: (Snorts) Trust me, we are not a couple.
Sheldon: Excuse me. I dont see why you get to snort derisively and point that out. Youd be lucky to land a fella like me.
Penny: Fine, go ahead.
Sheldon: (Snorts) Trust me, we are not a couple.
Assistant: My apologies. How can I help you today?
Penny: Hes in trouble with his girlfriend and needs to buy her a present.
Assistant: Great, trouble with girlfriends is whats putting my daughter through USC.
Penny: Ooh, are these real diamonds?
Assistant: Yes. Channel set baguettes, 20 points total weight.
Sheldon: Remarkable. Diamonds, crystallized carbon. Every day, people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire. But just because youve got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly, you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars.
Assistant: Actually, thats only 750. Everythings on sale.
Sheldon: Really. Talk to me about that pocket watch.
Scene: The apartment. The guys are playing Donkey Kong Jenga.
Howard: Im still trying to wrap my mind around it. I always thought Id be a dad someday.
Raj: Oh, me, too. Youre so caring. Ive often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood.
Leonard: There you go, Howard. Sounds like Rajll have your babies, problem solved.
Raj: Hey, just because a man shows caring for another man doesnt mean hes displaying the love that dare not speak its name. Did she definitely say she didnt want kids?
Howard: Yeah, she doesnt like them. And from what I saw, the feeling was mutual.
Leonard: What are you gonna do?
Howard: I dont know. I cant see a life where I dont have kids. I mean, people have kids. I mean, even Donkey Kong had Donkey Kong Jr. So he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses and throw barrels at Italian plumbers.
Leonard: You know, theres no guarantee even if you have kids that youre going to like them.
Raj: Wow, thats rough. Whered you get that?
Leonard: Its right off the dust jacket of my moms last book.
Howard: Maybe me and Bernadette arent right for each other.
Leonard: Look, Howard, Id say theres a lot of fish in the sea, but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years. Do not throw her back.
Howard: I dont want to, but this is kind of a deal breaker.
Raj: Whats your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?
Howard: Huh, itll kill her. On the other hand, if I dont give her grandchildren, thatll kill her, too. So, either way, on the Mom front, Im golden.
Scene: Pennys apartment.
Sheldon: What time did you tell Amy to be here?
Penny: Eight oclock. (Sheldon checks pocket watch) Sheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous.
Sheldon: Nonsense. I look like a train conductor. Under what pretext did you lure her here?
Penny: I said, hey, want to come over and hang out?
Sheldon: Good, good, if you had said something clever, she mightve gotten suspicious.
Amy: Hey.
Penny: Hi.
Amy: Whats he doing here?
Penny: Okay, he wants to talk to you.
Amy: Well, I dont want to talk to him. And Im pretty disappointed in you, too. Although we both know that wont last.
Penny: Sheldon, youre up.
Sheldon: Thank you. Amy, Id like to apologize. Your accomplishment was impressive. And Im proud of you.
Amy: We both know thats your koala face.
Sheldon: I told you.
Penny: Okay, look, he bought you this.
Amy: Jewellery? Seriously? Sheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centred person I have ever met. Do you really think another transparently manip..oh! Its a tiara! A tiara! I have a tiara! Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me.
Penny: You look beautiful.
Amy: Of course I do, Im a princess, and this is my tiara!
Sheldon: Youre right, the tiara was too much.
Scene: Howards bedroom.
Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard! Bernadettes Oh, she slipped right by me.
Bernadette: Heres your vest back.
Howard: You should keep it. You could wear it again sometime.
Bernadette: Where?
Howard: I dont know, hunting?
Mrs Wolowitz (off): Dont forget to talk to her about this mishegas where I dont get grandkids!
Howard: Dont worry, Ma. I will, as soon as I can figure out a way to bring up such a sensitive issue!
Bernadette: I guess you talked to your mom, huh?
Howard: I was upset. My mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on, if the smell of Bengay doesnt burn your eyes.
Bernadette: Look, its obvious having kids is really important to you, and I think I came up with a solution.
Howard: Really? Thats great. What?
Bernadette: Well, seeing as how I make way more money than you anyway, what if I work and you stay home with the kids?
Howard: Me?
Bernadette: Yeah. You know, youll watch Barney and pull Cheerios out of their noses and go on play dates, and Ill work and have conversations with people my own age and enjoy my life.
Howard: Yeah.
Bernadette: Yay, so were good.
Howard: Yeah, were good.
Bernadette: You know, I dont know if this counted as a fight, but how about some make-up sex?
Howard: I would love that. But what is that behind your ear? Oh, look, its a condom.
