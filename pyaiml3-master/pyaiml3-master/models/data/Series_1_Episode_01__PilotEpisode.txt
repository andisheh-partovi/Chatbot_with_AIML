Scene: A corridor at a sperm bank.
Sheldon: So if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits. If its unobserved it will, however, if its observed after its left the plane but before it hits its target, it will not have gone through both slits.
Leonard: Agreed, whats your point?
Sheldon: Theres no point, I just think its a good idea for a tee-shirt. 
Leonard: Excuse me?
Receptionist: Hang on. 
Leonard: One across is Aegean, eight down is Nabakov, twenty-six across is MCM, fourteen down is move your finger phylum, which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Docs capital idea, thats Port-au-Prince. Haiti. 
Receptionist: Can I help you?
Leonard: Yes. Um, is this the High IQ sperm bank?
Receptionist: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldnt be here.
Sheldon: I think this is the place.
Receptionist: Fill these out.
Leonard: Thank-you. Well be right back.
Receptionist: Oh, take your time. Ill just finish my crossword puzzle. Oh wait.
(They sit and begin to fill in forms).
Sheldon: Leonard, I dont think I can do this.
Leonard: What, are you kidding? Youre a semi-pro. 
Sheldon: No. We are committing genetic fraud. Theres no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
Leonard: Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment.
Sheldon: I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads, but theres some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesnt know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve.
Leonard: Im sure shell still love him.
Sheldon: I wouldnt.
Leonard: Well, what do you want to do?
Sheldon: I want to leave.
Leonard: Okay.
Sheldon: Whats the protocol for leaving?
Leonard: I dont know, Ive never reneged on a proffer of sperm before.
Sheldon: Lets try just walking out.
Leonard: Okay.

Receptionist: Bye.
Sheldon: Bye-bye
Leonard: See you.
Scene: The stairs of the apartment building.
Sheldon: Are you still mad about the sperm bank?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Leonard: Not really.
Sheldon: If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip.
Leonard: I dont care. Two millimetres? That doesnt seem right.
Sheldon: No, its true, I did a series of experiments when I was twelve, my father broke his clavicle.
Leonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Sheldon: No, that was the result of my work with lasers.
Leonard: New neighbour?
Sheldon: Evidently.
Leonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbour.
Sheldon: Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is.
Penny: Oh, hi!
Leonard: Hi.
Sheldon: Hi.
Leonard: Hi.
Sheldon: Hi.
Penny: Hi?
Leonard: We dont mean to interrupt, we live across the hall.
Penny: Oh, thats nice.
Leonard: Oh uh no we dont live together um we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms.
Penny: Oh, okay, well, guess Im your new neighbour, Penny.
Leonard: Leonard, Sheldon.
Penny: Hi.
Leonard: Hi.
Sheldon: Hi.
Penny: Hi. 
Leonard: Hi. Well, uh, oh, welcome to the building.
Penny: Thankyou, maybe we can have coffee sometime.
Leonard: Oh, great.
Penny: Great. 
Sheldon: Great.
Leonard: Great. Well, bye.
Penny: Bye.
Sheldon: Bye.
Leonard: Bye. 
Leonard: Should we have invited her for lunch?
Sheldon: No. Were going to start Season Two of Battlestar Galactica.
Leonard: We already watched the Season Two DVDs.
Sheldon: Not with commentary.
Leonard: I think we should be good neighbours, invite her over, make her feel welcome.
Sheldon: We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over.
Leonard: Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle.
Sheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace. 
Leonard: Yes, and youve never met one of them.
Sheldon: Thats the beauty of it.
Leonard: Im going to invite her over. Well have a nice meal and chat.
Sheldon: Chat? We dont chat. At least not offline.
Leonard: Well its not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response.
Sheldon: To what end?
Leonard: Hi. Again.
Penny: Hi.
Sheldon: Hi.
Leonard: Hi.
Penny: Hi. 
Leonard: Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when Im undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I dont have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about.
Sheldon: Leonard, Im not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements.
Penny: Oh, youre inviting me over to eat?
Leonard: Uh, yes.
Penny: Oh, thats so nice, Id love to.
Leonard: Great.
Penny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Sheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
Credits sequence.
Scene: Sheldon and Leonards apartment.
Leonard: Okay, well, make yourself at home.
Penny: Okay, thankyou.
Leonard: Youre very welcome.
Penny: This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this?
Sheldon: Actually thats my work.
Penny: Wow.
Sheldon: Yeah, well, its just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, thats just a joke, its a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation.
Penny: So youre like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys.
Sheldon: Yeah. 
Penny: This is really impressive.
Leonard: I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board.
Penny: Holy smokes.
Sheldon: If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any mens room at MIT, sure.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasnt seen this differential below here I sit broken hearted?
Leonard: At least I didnt have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.
Sheldon: I didnt invent them, theyre there.
Leonard: In what universe?
Sheldon: In all of them, that is the point.
Penny: Uh, do you guys mind if I start?
Sheldon: Um, Penny, thats where I sit.
Penny: So, sit next to me. 
Sheldon: No, I sit there.
Penny: Whats the difference?
Sheldon: Whats the difference?
Leonard: Here we go.
Sheldon: In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer its directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think Ive made my point. 
Penny: Do you want me to move?
Sheldon: Well.
Leonard: Just sit somewhere else.
Sheldon: Fine. (Wanders in circles, looking lost.)
Leonard: Sheldon, sit!

Sheldon: Aaah!
Leonard: Well this is nice. We dont have a lot of company over.
Sheldon: Thats not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time. 
Leonard: Yes I now, but
Sheldon: Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.
Leonard: Yes, I remember.
Sheldon: I resent you saying we dont have company.
Leonard: Im sorry.
Sheldon: That is an antisocial implication.
Leonard: I said Im sorry.
Penny: So, Klingon boggle?
Leonard: Yeah, its like regular boggle but, in Klingon. Thats probably enough about us, tell us about you.
Penny: Um, me, okay, Im Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know.
Sheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Suns apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality.
Penny: Participate in the what?
Leonard: I think what Sheldons trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldnt have been our first guess.
Penny: Oh, yeah, a lot of people think Im a water sign. Okay, lets see, what else, oh, Im a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak. 
Sheldon: Thats interesting. Leonard cant process corn.
Leonard: Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?
Penny: Oh, yeah, Im a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.
Leonard: Oh, okay. I love cheesecake.
Sheldon: Youre lactose intolerant. 
Leonard: I dont eat it, I just think its a good idea.
Penny: Oh, anyways, Im also writing a screenplay. Its about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.
Leonard: So its based on your life?
Penny: No, Im from Omaha. 
Leonard: Well, if that was a movie I would go see it.
Penny: I know, right? Okay, lets see, what else? Um, thats about it. Thats the story of Penny.
Leonard: Well it sounds wonderful.
Penny: It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk. 
Sheldon (mouths): Whats happening.
Leonard (mouths back): I dont know.
Penny: Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, thats like as long as High School. 
Sheldon: It took you four years to get through High School?
Leonard: Dont.
Penny: I just, I cant believe I trusted him.

Leonard: Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.
Sheldon: You? No, youll only make it worse.
Penny: You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?
Sheldon: Yes. 
Leonard: No, its not crazy its, uh, uh, its a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didnt make it worse.
Penny: Oh, Im so sorry, Im such a mess, and on top of everything else Im all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesnt even work.
Leonard: Our shower works.
Penny: Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?
Sheldon: Yes. 
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: No?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: No.
Leonard: Its right down the hall.
Penny: Thanks. You guys are really sweet.

Sheldon: Well this is an interesting development. 
Leonard: How so?
Sheldon: It has been some time since weve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.
Leonard: Thats not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimers had that episode.
Sheldon: Point taken. It has been some time since weve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didnt want to rip our eyes out. 
Leonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
Sheldon: So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?
Leonard: Excuse me?
Sheldon: That woman in theres not going to have sex with you.
Leonard: Well Im not trying to have sex with her.
Sheldon: Oh, good. Then you wont be disappointed.
Leonard: What makes you think she wouldnt have sex with me, Im a male and shes a female?
Sheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.
Leonard: Im not going to engage in hypotheticals here, Im just trying to be a good neighbour.
Sheldon: Oh, of course.
Leonard: Thats not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldnt participate. However briefly.
Sheldon: Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?
Leonard: Its Darth Vader shampoo. (There is a knock on the door.) Luke Skywalkers the conditioner.

Howard: Wait till you see this.
Raj: Its fantastic. Unbelievable.
Leonard: See what?
Howard: Its a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Leonard: This is not a good time.
Howard: Its before he became a creepy computer voice:.
Leonard: Thats great, you guys have to go.
Raj: Why?
Leonard: Its just not a good time.
Sheldon: Leonard has a lady over.
Howard: Yeah, right, your grandmother back in town?
Leonard: No. And shes not a lady, shes just a new neighbour.
Howard: Hang on, there really is a lady here?
Leonard: Uh-huh.
Howard: And you want us out because youre anticipating coitus?
Leonard: Im not anticipating coitus.
Howard: So shes available for coitus?
 Leonard: Can we please stop saying coitus?
Sheldon: Technically that would be coitus interruptus.
Penny: Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower. Oh. Hi, sorry. Hello!
Howard: Enchante Madamoiselle. Howard Wolowitz, Cal-Tech department of Applied Physics. You may be familiar with some of my work, its currently orbiting Jupiters largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs.
Penny: Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory.
Leonard: Come on, Ill show you the trick with the shower.
Howard: Bon douche.
Penny: Im sorry?
Howard: Its French for good shower. Its a sentiment I can express in six languages.
Leonard: Save it for your blog, Howard.
Howard: See-ka-tong-guay-jow.
Scene: In the bathroom.
Leonard: Uh, there it goes, it sticks, Im sorry.
Penny: Okay. Thanks. 
Leonard: Youre welcome, oh, youre going to step right, okay, Ill.
Penny: Hey, Leonard?
Leonard: The hair products are Sheldons.
Penny: Um, okay. Can I ask you a favour.
Leonard: A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you.
Penny: Its okay if you say no.
Leonard: Oh, Ill probably say yes.
Penny: Its just not the kind of thing you ask a guy youve just met.
Leonard: Wow.
Scene: Leonard and Sheldon, Inside Leonards car
Sheldon: I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.
Leonard: Must we?
Sheldon: Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned womans ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?
Leonard: She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon.
Sheldon: Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.
Leonard: Which is?
Sheldon: You think with your penis.
Leonard: Thats a biological impossibility and you didnt have to come.
Sheldon: Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why cant she get her own TV.
Leonard: Come on, you know how it is with break-ups.
Sheldon: No I dont. And neither do you.
Leonard: Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim.
Sheldon: You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea.
Leonard: To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. Theres some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.
Sheldon: So we get to have a scene with him?
Leonard: No, Sheldon, theres not going to be a scene. Theres two of us and one of him.
Sheldon: Leonard, the two of us cant even carry a TV. 
Scene: Back at the apartment.
Penny (to Raj): So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the University?
(Raj looks at her, looks back at his food, takes a mouthful).
Penny: Uh, Im sorry, do you speak English?
Howard: Oh, he speaks English, he just cant speak to women.
Penny: Really, why?
Howard: Hes kind of a nerd. Juice box?
Scene: Outside Pennys old apartment building.
Leonard (pushes buzzer): Ill do the talking.
Voice from buzzer: Yeah.
Leonard: Hi, Im Leonard, this is Sheldon.
Sheldon: Hello.
Leonard: What did I just. Uh, were here to pick up Pennys TV.
Voice: Get lost.
Sheldon: Okay, thanks for your time.
Leonard: Were not going to give up just like that.
Sheldon: Leonard, the TV is in the building, weve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done.
Leonard: Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang.
Sheldon: My apologies. Whats your plan.
(Leonard starts rattling the doors violently.)
Sheldon: Its just a privilege to watch your mind at work.
Leonard: Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.
(Two girl scouts arrive carrying bags of cookies. One runs her hand down the intercom, pushing all the buttons. The door is buzzed open.)
Sheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is?
Leonard: Just grab the door.
Scene: Outside Pennys ex-boyfriends apartment.
Leonard: This is it. (Knocks.) Ill do the talking.
Sheldon: Good thinking, Ill just be the muscle.
Enormous man: Yeah?
Leonard: Im Leonard, this is Sheldon.
Sheldon: From the intercom.
Man: How the hell did you get in the building?
Leonard: Oh. Were scientists.
Sheldon: Tell him about our IQ.
Scene: Outside the apartment building. Leonard and Sheldon exit. They are not wearing trousers.
Sheldon: Leonard.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: My mom bought me those pants.
Leonard: Im sorry.
Sheldon: Youre going to have to call her.
Scene: On the stairs of Sheldon and Leonards building.
Leonard: Sheldon, Im so sorry I dragged you through this.
Sheldon: Its okay. It wasnt my first pantsing, and it wont be my last.
Leonard: And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex.
Sheldon: Well you got me out of my pants.
Leonard: Anyway, Ive learned my lesson. Shes out of my league, Im done with her, Ive got my work, one day Ill win the Nobel Prize and then Ill die alone.
Sheldon: Dont think like that, youre not going to die alone.
Leonard: Thank you Sheldon, youre a good friend.
Sheldon: And youre certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.
Scene: Inside Sheldon and Leonards apartment.
Howard: This is one of my favourite places to kick back after a quest, they have a great house ale.
Penny: Wow, cool tiger.
Howard: Yeah, Ive had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.
Penny: Uh, sounds interesting.
Howard: So youll think about it?
Penny: Oh, I dont think Ill be able to stop thinking about it.
Raj: Smooth.
Leonard: Were home.
Penny: Oh, my God, what happened?
Leonard: Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.
Penny: Im so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldnt be such an ass.
Leonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Sheldon: That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?
Penny: Really, thank you so much for going and trying youre, uh, youre so terrific. Why dont you put some clothes on, Ill get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?
Leonard: Really? Great.
Sheldon: Thank you. Youre not done with her, are you?
Leonard: Our babies will be smart and beautiful.
Sheldon: Not to mention imaginary.
Scene: All five in Leonards car.
Leonard: Is Thai food okay with you Penny?
Penny: Sure.
Sheldon: We cant have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch.
Penny: So?
Sheldon: Theyre both curry based cuisines.
Penny: So?
Sheldon: They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see were going to have to spell out everything for this girl.
Penny: Any ideas Raj? (He just looks at her with a worried expression.)
Howard: Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.
Penny: That sounds like fun.
Howard (sings): Baby, baby dont get hooked on me. Uh, baby, baby dont get hooked on me.
Sheldon: I dont know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, youre a veritable Mack Daddy.
