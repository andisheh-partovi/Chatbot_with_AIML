Scene: The lobby.
Penny: Oh, damn, they cancelled my Visa. Oh, yay, a new MasterCard!
Sheldon: Uh-oh.
Penny: What?
Sheldon: I was going to get my mail.
Penny: Okay. Are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?
Sheldon: I think you mean telekinetically. And no, I just wasnt sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus.
Penny: God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?
Sheldon: Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus.
Penny: Okay, heres the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus.
Sheldon: Good, good. Im glad were still friends.
Penny: Really?
Sheldon: Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. Id hate for that effort to have been in vain.
Penny: Right.
Sheldon: Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?
Penny: Everyone.
Sheldon: Harsh terms. But all right, Ill just substitute intercourse.
Penny: Great.
Sheldon: Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so Ill hold that in reserve.
Penny: So, how you been?
Sheldon: Well, my existence is a continuum, so Ive been what I am at each point in the implied time period.
Penny: Youre just coitusing with me, arent you?
Sheldon: Bazinga.
Penny: Mmm. Hows Leonard doing?
Sheldon: He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that.
Penny: Ill pretend I didnt hear it.
Sheldon: Id rather you pretend I didnt say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.
Penny: Yep.
Sheldon: Thats the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, thats what the Romans made Jesus eat.
Penny: Interesting. Ill have to have you over for spaghetti some night.
Sheldon: Im hungry now.
Penny: Oh. Um, okay. Why dont you give me an hour and come over?
Sheldon: Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?
Penny: I dont have hot dogs.
Sheldon: Oh, its all right, I do. Oh! Youre in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat. (Enters apartment).
Leonard: Hey, where you been?
Sheldon: I was talking with Penny.
Howard: Whats wrong with you? You cant hang out with your roommates ex. Thats totally uncool.
Leonard: No, no, its fine. I dont care. Im over it.
Raj: Yeah, hes over it, thats why hes been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.
Sheldon: Is he making any progress? Because Id like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.
Howard: So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. Youre either on Team Leonard or Team Penny.
Sheldon: Which one picks last?
Howard: What?
Sheldon: Well, usually Im on the team that picks last. Unless theres a kid in a wheelchair.
Leonard: Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope youre hungry.
Sheldon: Well, of course Im hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!
Leonard: Okay.
Sheldon: Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?
Leonard: I dont know. Why?
Sheldon: Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard!
Credits sequence
 
Scene: A few moments later.
Howard: Oh, God, this is good.
Raj: Let me ask you a question. Do you believe youre going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?
Howard: Jews dont have hell. We have acid reflux.
Leonard: Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?
Sheldon: Certainly. Its not like I have to moderate my food intake because Im planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!
Leonard: So, you guys want to do something tonight?
Howard: Nah, I cant. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World.
Leonard: What about you, Raj?
Raj: Oh, there it is, now that you dont have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again.
Leonard: I never stopped hanging out with you.
Raj: Oh, please, we all know Im the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, Id be Aquaman.
Howard: I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.
Sheldon: Excuse me, Im thirsty, so Im going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.
Leonard: You know what? Ill just spend the evening alone.
Raj: What, suddenly Im not good enough for you?
Sheldon: Ah, I do so love beverages. Now I think Ill take my after-dinner walk.
Leonard: Since when do you take after-dinner walks?
Howard: Yeah, since when do you take walks?
Sheldon: I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if theres one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, its serotonin. Bye-bye.
Howard: Hold on. Ill walk down with you.
Sheldon: Oh, thats not necessary. You can go first.
Howard: Or we could go together.
Sheldon: I cant think of a reason why not.
Howard: Lets go.
Sheldon: Hold on. Nope, no reason.
Raj: Ive missed you.
Scene: The lobby.
Sheldon: All right, say hello to your mother for me.
Howard: Okay.
Sheldon: What?
Howard: You said you were going for a walk.
Sheldon: I didnt say outside.
Howard: So what, youre just gonna walk up and down the stairs?
Sheldon: No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior.
Womans voice: Here Bubbles. Here boy.
Howard: Which way are you going?
Sheldon: Which way are you going?
Howard: I parked my scooter down the block.
Sheldon: Im going the other way. Bye.
Howard: Bye. Actually, Im this way. Do I smell hot dogs?
Sheldon: No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell.
Howard: I definitely smell raw hot dog.
Sheldon: Perhaps youre getting a brain tumour.
Howard: All right, have a nice walk.
Sheldon: I shall. Have a nice scoot.
Howard: You might want to stand back. Im sitting on top of 13 horses here.
Sheldon: Oh. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat!
Scene: Pennys apartment.
Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Long pause, knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Penny opens door. A dishevelled Sheldon is holding up one hot dog.) Here. I had to trade the others for my life.
Scene: The apartment.
Raj: Hey, Leonard?
Leonard: Yeah?
Raj: I havent had sex in a year.
Leonard: Where you going with this, Raj?
Raj: Dont flatter yourself, dude. I want to go out and meet a woman.
Leonard: So, go.
Raj: Well, I need a wingman. I dont want to come off like a lonely loser.
Leonard: And you think my presence will help with that?
Raj: Well, I do. Next to you, Ill look like a catch.
Leonard: Im not going out tonight, Raj.
Raj: All right. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography?
Leonard: Very much.
Raj: Doesnt have to be Asian.
Leonard: Dont worry. Youll meet a girl someday.
Raj: No, I wont.
Leonard: Yes, you will, and shell be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman.
Raj: You really think so?
Leonard: I do, and youll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And shell take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces.
Raj: But well have sex first, right?
Scene: Pennys apartment.
Sheldon: Mmm, mmm, mmm. Thats Eye-talian.
Penny: So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?
Sheldon: Oh, yes. In fact, he said, Im fine, I dont care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal.
Penny: Well, good.
Sheldon: Im also pleased to report that hes all cried out over you.
Penny: Hes been crying?
Sheldon: Oh, I believe that was something else I wasnt supposed to mention.
Penny: Oh, God, I feel terrible.
Sheldon: Do you have a stomach ache, too?
Penny: No. Why, do you?
Sheldon: No.
Penny: Why did you ask if I had one, too?
Sheldon: Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn.
Penny: All right. So, whats new in your life?
Sheldon: Well, my new shoes are not made for running.
Penny: Have you been running?
Sheldon: No. Its just a suspicion I have. Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Penny: Im so glad you like it.
Sheldon: I do. Leonard never cooks for me.
Penny: Well, maybe thats cause Leonard cant cook.
Sheldon: You cant cook and you made me this.
Penny: Whatever. Ooh, Im gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge.
Sheldon: Oh, Lord, Im in Jewish hell.
Scene: The apartment.
Raj: Look at this. Do you think shes really doing that or is it PhotoShop?
Leonard: Im pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys.
Raj: You dont know that. Prison changes people.
Leonard: Hey, where you been?
Sheldon: I told you, walking.
Leonard: For an hour and a half?
Sheldon: I got lost.
Leonard: How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.
Sheldon: Satellites are down. Solar flares.
Raj: There are no solar flares right now.
Sheldon: Yes, there are.
Raj: Dude, Im an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, Id be all up in it.
Sheldon: Im sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my battery died.
Leonard: What the hell was that about?
Raj: I dont know. Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah?
Leonard: Oh, we really need to get you a girl.
Scene: Leonards bedroom. Leonard is asleep.
Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard.
Leonard: Oh, just come in!
Sheldon: Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
Leonard: What do you want, Sheldon?
Sheldon: Maybe this isnt a good time.
Leonard: Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.
Sheldon: Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.
Leonard: What do you want?
Sheldon: You may want to sit down.
Leonard: Im in bed!
Sheldon: Point taken. You may want to sit up.
Leonard: Sheldon!
Sheldon: Ive been seeing Penny behind your back.
Leonard: Okay, when you say seeing Penny, what exactly does that mean?
Sheldon: We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it?
Leonard: Fine. Why did you have dinner with Penny?
Sheldon: I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.
Leonard: Then why did you have Chinese food with us?
Sheldon: I didnt want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.
Leonard: Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?
Sheldon: Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos.
Leonard: Sheldon, I dont care if you want to be friends with Penny.
Sheldon: Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil thats been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon: Well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon.
Leonard: I guess not.
Sheldon: And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound, or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.
Scene: The laundry room.
Penny: Oh, um, I, I can come back.
Leonard: D-dont be silly. Were neighbours, were going to run into each other, may as well get used to it.
Penny: Yeah, I guess youre right.
Leonard: You used to it yet?
Penny: Nope.
Leonard: Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know its fine.
Penny: Oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me.
Leonard: His mother?
Penny: Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels.
Leonard: I was going to do that.
Penny: Oh, well, then you, you do it.
Leonard: No, I dont want to do it. You can do it.
Penny: Okay, you can take him for shoes.
Leonard: I just took him for shoes.
Penny: Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet.
Leonard: Fine. Ill take him for shoes next Saturday.
Penny: Oh, no, no, no, a bunch of us from work are going to Disneyland next Saturday and Sheldon wants to come.
Leonard: Youre taking him to Disneyland?
Penny: Well, he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going to say no?
Leonard: All right. But let me know if youre going to stuff him with junk food. I dont want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.
Penny: Were going to Disneyland. Hes going to eat junk food.
Leonard: All Im saying is give me a heads-up.
Penny: Okay, whatever.
Leonard: And dont let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. Hell say he can handle it, but I promise youll end up with churro puke on your shoes.
Penny: All right, got it. Is there anything else?
Leonard: Yeah, dont let Goofy near him. Hell have nightmares and Ill have to deal with it.
Penny: Whats the problem with Goofy?
Leonard: Wish I knew. Hes fine with Pluto.
Scene: The apartment. 
Raj: Hey, do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?
Howard: Well, thats it. Were officially out of things to talk about.
Penny: Were home.
Leonard: Its ten oclock, where have you been?
Sheldon: We stayed for the California Adventure water show. It was pure Disney magic.
Leonard: I was going to see that with him.
Penny: How was I supposed to know that?
Sheldon: Its all right. Ill see it again with you.
Leonard: And I have food here. You said you were going to call.
Penny: I know, I know.
Sheldon: I can still eat.
Penny: No, you already threw up once. Go put on your PJs and brush your teeth.
Sheldon: Okay, but just dont fight
Leonard: Were not fighting.
Penny: Just go.
Leonard: Arent you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?
Sheldon: Thank you, Penny.
Penny: Youre welcome, sweetie.
Leonard: Want a cup of coffee?
Penny: Oh, um, I should probably get going.
Leonard: Come on. Its just a cup of coffee.
Penny: Yep, okay.
Howard (to Raj, who has whispered to him): Oh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too.
Leonard: What am I smelling?
Penny: Sheldons churro on my shoes.
Scene: Sheldons bedroom.
Penny: Hes such an angel when hes asleep.
Leonard: Yeah. Shame he has to wake up.
Penny: I think we can do it.
Leonard: Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldnt that be wrong?
Penny: No, be friends. You and me.
Leonard: Oh. Sure. Absolutely.
Penny: Good. Im glad.
Leonard: Heres an idea. Im just throwing it out there, friends who have sex.
Penny: Good night, Leonard.
Leonard: Kidding. Just a couple of friends goofin around.
Sheldon (in his sleep): No, Goofy, no.
