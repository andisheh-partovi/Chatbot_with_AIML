Scene: The apartment. 
Steph: I dont see anything at all, Sheldon.
Sheldon: Well, youre the doctor, but I am constantly hearing this annoying sound.
Leonard: Me, too.
Sheldon: Is it a high-frequency whistle?
Leonard: No, its more of a relentless, narcissistic drone.
Steph: Yup, theres no inflammation at all, Sheldon.
Sheldon: Then it must be a tumour.
Steph: I Seriously doubt it.
Leonard: Maybe its a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.
Sheldon: Is that possible? I used to get those all the time. Even in church.
Steph: Well, you know, if it is from a swirly, theres something I can do. Okay, circle, circle, dot, dot, now you have a cootie shot! Im going to bed
Leonard: Okay, Ill be right in.
Sheldon: Its not enough that she mocks me, but that isnt even the correct procedure for a cootie shot.
Leonard: Do you understand that Stephanies not here to treat your imaginary ailments?
Sheldon: How is it imaginary that I keep hearing an octave above Middle C? Is that imaginary? I dont think so.
Leonard: Good night.
Sheldon: Leonard, theres one more thing. Under Article One, Section Three of our Roommate Agreement, Im calling an emergency meeting.
Leonard: No, youre not.
Sheldon: Leonard moves the meeting not occur. Is there a second? None heard, the motion fails. Id like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.
Leonard: Thank you.
Sheldon: That being said, we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon cohabitation rider which has been activated now that the two of you are living together.
Leonard: Were not living together.
Sheldon: I beg to disagree. A girlfriend shall be deemed quote living with un-quote Leonard when she has stayed over for A, ten consecutive nights or B, more than nine nights in three week period or C: all the weekends of a given month plus three weeknights.
Leonard: Thats absurd.
Sheldon: You initialed it. See? L.H., L.H., L.H.
Leonard: Wait, I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen! I initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers.
Sheldon: Hmm, yes, you did. Now, to review the following provisions are hereby activated. In the refrigerator, as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf, the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal. Next, apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells. Third,the bathroom schedule. Now, Im given to understand women have different needs, so, well have to discuss that.
Leonard: Im going to bed.
Sheldon: At least take this with you. Look, and have Stephanie initial here, here, here, here and here. This states that she does not now nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument. Sure it sounds like a tumor pressing on the auditory nerve.
Credits sequence.
 
Scene: The kitchen.
Leonard: No, absolutely not.
Sheldon: Its not a big deal. We have latex gloves.
Leonard: I dont care what the symptoms are, my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam.
Steph: Hi, Sheldon.
Sheldon: Good morning, Dr. Stephanie. I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night.
Leonard: Oh come on! Sheldon, we dont ask questions like that.
Sheldon: I heard you ask it over and over. How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?
Steph: He did very nicely.
Sheldon: See? Shes not offended. And now you finally have an answer.
Penny (entering): Out of coffee. Need coffee.
Steph: Uh, hello.
Penny: Hi! Stephanie, right?
Steph: Uh-huh. And, and, and you are?
Penny: Im Penny, I live across the hall. Ive heard a lot about you.
Steph: Really?
Penny: Mm-hmm.
Steph: I havent heard a thing about you. Leonard? Why havent I heard a thing about this woman who lives across the hall and comes into your apartment in the morning in her underwear?
Leonard: Shes heard about you because were, you know, involved and you havent heard about her because I never slept with her, I swear!
Sheldon: In Leonards defence, it wasnt for lack of trying.
Leonard: Thank you, Sheldon.
Sheldon: Youre welcome, Leonard.
Leonard: Look, Im just saying, um, Penny is one of our many neighbours, you know, and in our building, neighbours come and go, its very casual, no dress code. In fact, some mornings Ill just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.
Sheldon: Really? I have never once been invited to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.
Leonard: She doesnt like you. Um, well, uh, you have a gall bladder to remove and I have to get in the shower and Penny has clothes to put on, so
Steph: Well, it was very nice meeting you.
Penny: Nice to finally meet you, too.
Steph: And Ill see you tonight?
Leonard: Okay, bye-bye.
Steph: Bye.
Sheldon: What could I possibly have done to offend Mrs. Vartabedian?
Penny: So, thats Stephanie, huh?
Leonard: Why do I feel like Im the one that just got the prostate exam?
Penny: You know, she seems very nice.
Sheldon: Oh, she is. Shes terrific, and shes proving to be a valuable roommate.
Penny: Roommate? You guys are living together?
Sheldon: Like hippies.
Leonard: Were not living together.
Sheldon: Do I have to pull out the paperwork again?
Leonard: Were not living together.
Penny: Are you sure?
Leonard: How could I not be sure?
Penny: Well, lets find out.
Leonard: Dont you think if a woman was living with me Id be the first one to know about it?
Penny: Oh, sweetie, youd be the last one to know about it. (Looking through his wardrobe) Hmm, cute dresses. I bet this looks great on you!
Leonard: Were not living together.
Penny: Okay, hmm, scented candles, fuzzy slippers, ooh, floral bed sheets?
Leonard: Were not living together.
Penny: Okay, moving on. Now, who are these guys at Disney World?
Leonard: Uh, the big dog is Goofy, and the older couple with the mouse ears , I have no idea. Were not living together!
Penny: Youre going to go down swinging, huh? All right, well, we got your body lotion, your InStyle Magazine, your jewellery box.
Leonard: Were not Wheres my Bat Signal?
Penny: You have a Bat Signal?
Leonard: I did. It was right here. She mustve Oh, my God, were living together.
Penny: Really? What was your first clue?
Scene: The university cafeteria.
 
Howard: New pants?
Leonard: Yeah, Stephanie got them for me.
Howard: Nice. Cotton?
Leonard: Actually, I think its more of wool, fire ant blend.
Howard: So, the girlfriends buying clothes for you, huh? Sounds serious.
Leonard: It is actually. In fact, I gave it a lot of thought and I decided it was time for us to live together.
Howard: Uh, Leonard, huge mistake. Theres a whole buffet of women out there and youre just standing in the corner eating the same devilled egg over and over again.
Leonard: At least I have an egg. What do you have?
Howard: A veritable smorgasbord of potential sexual partners. See the blonde over there? I can hit on her and you cant.
Leonard: So, go hit on her.
Howard: Shes not my type.
Raj: Too bad, cause she was checking you out before.
Howard: She was?
Raj: Of course not. Look at her.
Leonard: I dont care what you guys think, Stephanie and I are very happy living together. I will give either of you 20 dollars, right now to trade pants with me.
Scene: The hospital.
Steph: Sheldon, what are you doing here?
Sheldon: Hang on. 130 over 80. A little high. We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk.
Steph: Where did you get the stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff?
Sheldon: My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday. She thought if I failed at theoretical physics that I should have a trade to fall back on. And by the way, the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer.
Steph: Thank you.
Sheldon: Didnt they teach you that in medical school?
Steph: Im kinda busy here, Sheldon.
Sheldon: I understand. All I need is for you to authorize these tests.
Steph: A cardiac stress test, a full body MRI, an electromyogram, a CBC, baseline glucose, upper GI?
Sheldon: Oh, and an exploratory laparoscopy. Last time I had hiccups, it felt like my diaphragm was just going through the motions.
Steph: Go home, Sheldon.
Sheldon: Can I at least have the upper GI? I already drank the barium!
Scene: The laundry room.
Penny: Oh hey.
Leonard: Oh, good. Do you have any fabric softener?
Penny: Yeah, sure. What are you washing? A crocodile?
Leonard: No, the pants that Stephanie got me.
Penny: Oh, sweetie, you cant machine wash these. Theyll be ruined.
Leonard: Are you sure?
Penny: Absolutely.
Leonard: Oh, no. I wish youd told me that sooner.
Penny: Are you guys having problems?
Leonard: No, everythings fine.
Penny: Really?
Leonard: Yeah. Its wonderful. Okay, maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly, but its fine, its great.
Penny: Okay, Leonard, honey, you know, if youre uncomfortable with the way things are going, youre allowed to say something.
Leonard: Are you sure? That doesnt sound right.
Penny: Believe me, your feelings are just as important as hers.
Leonard: No that doesnt sound right either.
Penny: Just tell her you need the relationship to move at a pace that you both are comfortable with.
Leonard: Yeah, I could say something like that to her. Ill go do that. Thank you.
Penny: Sure.
Leonard: You have a really good grasp on this. Maybe you could talk to her?
Penny: Youre kidding, right?
Leonard: No, but thats okay. Ill go talk to her. Want to come with?
Penny: Go! Wow.
Scene: The apartment.
 
Steph: Oh, no.
Sheldon: Wha??
Steph: You were right. Your larynx is terribly inflamed. I mean, Ive never seen anything like it.
Sheldon: I knew it! What do I do?
Steph: Youre going to need to stop talking immediately.
Sheldon: For how
Steph: Du-du-du-du! Immediately.
Leonard: Hey.
Steph: Oh, hi, honey.
Leonard: Sheldon. (He waves) Whats going on?
Steph: I just performed a Sheldonectomy.
Leonard: Careful, if you dont get it all, itll only come back worse.
Steph: Gotcha.
Leonard: Listen, we need to talk.
Steph: Oh-oh. Do we need to talk or do we need to talk?
Leonard: I dont know what that means.
Steph: Okay, why dont you just tell me what it is you have to tell me?
Leonard: Okay, um, well, look, its just that things between you and me have been going pretty quick.
Steph: And?
Leonard: Its just a little scary.
Steph: Well, yeah, but scary good, right?
Leonard: Sure, when is scary not good? But, okay, um, I have feelings, right?
Steph: Uh-huh.
Leonard: Okay, and its perfectly okay to express those feelings, right?
Steph: Of course honey why dont you tell me what it is youre feeling?
Leonard: Okay, well, I ju I think its important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed and oh, shoot, I had it!
Steph: Okay, how about this? How about I tell you what Im feeling?
Leonard: Whats that? Really? Right now?
Steph: Why not?
Leonard: I just ate, arent you supposed to wait an hour?
Steph: I think thats for swimming.
Leonard: Oh, okay. I just hope I dont get cramps.
Steph: Yeah.
Scene: The laundry room.
Leonard: Hey.
Penny: Hey. Oh, I put your clothes in the dryer.
Leonard: Thank you.
Penny: Your pants are ruined.
Leonard: Good.
Penny: So, how did the talk with Stephanie go?
Leonard: Well, um, on one level, really, really well.
Penny: So, you told her you wanted to slow things down?
Leonard: Not specifically, but, uh, I did tell her that I had feelings.
Penny: Good, good. And then what?
Leonard: And then the, the subject got changed somehow.
Penny: You had sex, didnt you?
Leonard: Um, little bit. (She looks at her watch) What?
Penny: Nothing. Okay, well, it sounds like things are going to work out.
Leonard: Yeah, yeah its all good. Everythings going to work out. One way or another.
Penny: Come on, Leonard, you are entitled to try and make things go the way you want them to.
Leonard: Really?
Penny: Yes, you dont always have to go along with what the woman wants.
Leonard: Huh.
Penny: What?
Leonard: Nothing, just rethinking my whole life. Okay, heres the thing, Im afraid that if I ask her to move out, shell just dump me.
Penny: Well, its a chance you have to take. I mean, look, if its meant to be, itll be.
Leonard: Very comforting. Okay, so what do I say to her?
Penny: I dont know. I mean, what have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down?
Leonard: I really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?
Penny: Yeah, thatll slow it down.
Scene: Leonards bedroom. Leonard and Steph have just had sex. 
 
Steph: Im sorry, I totally interrupted you. What were you saying?
Leonard: Oh, right, yeah, um, so, Stephanie, heres the thing. I really like you.
Steph: Oh, God, here comes the speech.
Leonard: What speech?
Steph: I really like you, but maybe we should spend a little less time together cause I need my space but Ill call you on Tuesday, and then you never call me so I call you, but you dont call me back and then when I run into you at the coffee shop you pretend like youve been having problems with your voice mail and I know that youre lying, but I pretend like I dont care even though Im dying inside!
Leonard: No! No, no! I wasnt going to say any of that. I was just going to say, I really like you.
Steph: Oh. Oh, good! Cause I really like you, too.
Leonard: Terrific.
Scene: The university cafeteria. 
 
Leonard: Hey.
Raj: Hey.
Howard: Hey. Nice sweater.
Leonard: Yeah, Stephanie got it for me. Its kind of fun.
Raj: Its got a big bird on it, dude.
Leonard: Yeah, yeah, thats the fun part. Were also getting new curtains for my bedroom, and a dust ruffle, and a duvet, and I dont even know what a duvet is but Im pretty sure if I did I wouldnt want one, but every time I talk to her about moving out she cries and we have sex.
Raj: Youre lucky. With me, its usually the other way around.
Howard: You know, if you cant talk to her, why dont you just text her?
Leonard: Isnt that kind of cowardly?
Howard: Oh, yeah. Its beyond contemptible.
Raj: Its true, but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater.
Leonard: Sold. I think it would be better for our relationship if you moved back to your place. There. Its done.
Howard: Good for you.
Leonard: Yeah, good for me. Ill never have sex again. (Phone buzzes) I was wrong. See ya.
