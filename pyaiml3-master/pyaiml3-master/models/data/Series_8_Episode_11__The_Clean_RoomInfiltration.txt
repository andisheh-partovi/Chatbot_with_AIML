Scene: The apartment. 
Penny: Hey, how are things going with your parents?
Raj; Not great. They hired divorce attorneys.
Sheldon: You know, speaking of attorneys, if I ever needed a lawyer, I would not hire She-Hulk.
Penny: You know what? That was almost on topic. Im gonna say good job, Sheldon.
Amy: Wait, She-Hulks a lawyer?
Howard: Yeah, she works at a law firm in New York.
Sheldon: Yes, but shes the only monster at the firm. Between you, me and the wall, I think shes an affirmative action hire.
Raj: Anyway, Dads gonna be here in town, so I wont be able to do Christmas dinner this year.
Amy: If youre not up to hosting Christmas dinner, Im happy to do it. You can even bring your father.
Raj: That would be nice.
Amy: Ive always wanted to do a traditional Victorian Christmas. Parlour games, goose and figgy pudding.
Sheldon: Ugh. English pudding. You get yourself all excited for pudding, and here comes a cake with raisins in it. Im not going.
Amy: Youre going.
Sheldon: Why do you hate me?
Amy: I dont hate you. I love you.
Sheldon: Well, you call it love, but it has a lot of raisins in it.
Raj: Amy, good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving.
Bernadette: I think a Victorian Christmas sounds nice.
Howard: I agree.
Leonard: Why not?
Penny: Me, too.
Raj: You guys suck.
Credits sequence. 
Scene: The University clean room.
Leonard: You know the best part of working in the clean room? No allergies. Check it out. Oh, that, that, thats a lot of oxygen.
Howard: We should get going to Amys.
Leonard: Can you believe there was a time when we would have needed an array of giant Cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles? And here we are building our own multi-wire detector like a couple of badasses.
Howard: I know. If we were still single, wed be tripping over all that booty.
Leonard: Ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag. Oh, no.
Howard: How the hell did a pigeon get in here?
Leonard: You shut the loading doors, right?
Howard: I thought you did.
Leonard: Do you know what a disaster this is?
Howard: You mean cause this room isnt supposed to have dust in it, and we just let in a flying crap machine?
Leonard: What do we do? Should we call someone?
Howard: And tell them that we compromised all the equipment? Lets just get it out of here before anyone knows.
Leonard: Okay, how do we catch it?
Howard: Well, what if we turn off all the lights except for one, and itll come to it.
Leonard: Its not a moth.
Howard: Dont yell at me. Youre not gonna get any good ideas out of me if youre yelling.
Leonard: Okay, so if I remain calm, Ill get more gems like turn off the lights?
Howard: Great, were turning on each other. Thats just what the bird wants us to do.
Scene: Amys apartment. 
Penny: So, Dr. Koothrappali, long flight?
Dr Koothrappali: Twenty hours.
Penny: Oh, thats rough.
Dr Koothrappali: Not at all. Did you know that when you fly transcontinental without your wife, you dont pray for the plane to crash?
Raj: Can we please talk about anything else?
Dr Koothrappali: Forgive me. How are you and Leonard?
Penny: Oh, great. Everythings good.
Dr Koothrappali: I see you got engaged.
Penny: Yes, we did.
Dr Koothrappali: Let me tell you a story.
Raj: Dad.
Dr Koothrappali: Sorry. Im sure you wont grow to hate each other.
Raj (on phone): Hey, Leonard. Whats up? What? How did that happen? Yeah, okay. Ill be there as soon as I can. Sorry. I have to run to the university.
Amy: Whats going on?
Raj: Theres been a problem with an experiment. A bird got into the clean room.
Dr Koothrappali: You want me to come?
Raj: Uh, no. You had a long flight. You stay here and relax.
Dr Koothrappali: Relax. Easy for you to say. Your mother isnt cleaning out your bank account. Forty years, the woman never cleaned a thing.
Penny: Youre just gonna leave him here?
Dr Koothrappali: Relax, he says.
Raj: Yup. Bye.
Scene: Bernadettes car.
Bernadette (singing): Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane. Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer pulling on the reins.
Sheldon: Yeah, I appreciate the ride.
Bernadette (singing): Bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright. So hang your stockings and say your prayers cause Santa Claus is coming tonight. Whyd you turn it off?
Sheldon: Because in the last ten minutes, Santa came to town, kissed Mommy and ran Grandma over with a reindeer. I had a drunk uncle who did all those things. Nobody sings songs about him.
Bernadette: Maybe youd like it more if you thought of Santa as a superhero and his power is bringing joy to children.
Sheldon: My uncle was accused of that, too. It turned out to be legal in Oklahoma.
Bernadette: Okay, new subject. Lets talk about presents. What did you get Amy?
Sheldon: Oh, were not exchanging gifts.
Bernadette: Come on, Sheldon, you have to get her something.
Sheldon: Why should I? She knows that I dont like Christmas, and yet, every year, she forces me to celebrate it. Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will, at the Christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe, and she kissed me under it in public. Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show.
Bernadette: Shes just excited about the holidays.
Sheldon: Yes, and shes not taking my feelings into account at all. Maybe its time I teach her a lesson.
Bernadette: How?
Sheldon: Hmm. Itd have to be something heinous, something that makes her as miserable as shes making me. Oh, Ive got it. This is good.
Bernadette: What?
Sheldon: Im going to buy her a present.
Bernadette: Yeah, youre gonna have to walk me through that.
Sheldon: With gift-giving, theres an implied social contract. If I show up tonight with a present, and she doesnt have one for me, shell feel terrible.
Bernadette: Then youre both sad?
Sheldon: Yes. Maybe shell feel so guilty, shell never make me celebrate the holidays again.
Bernadette: So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?
Sheldon: Thats right. So stay on my good side, or Ill get you a little something, too.
Scene: The clean room. 
Howard: Okay, heres the plan. Im gonna put the food in the bag, and when he lands in the bag to eat it, we close it up.
Leonard: A Slim Jim?
Howard: Its all I could find. Itll work.
Leonard: Sure. If the pigeons stoned or a trucker.
Howard: Okay, well, whats your plan?
Leonard: I told you my plan. Lets call Building Services and get help.
Howard: And admit that we contaminated the clean room?
Leonard: No, admit that you contaminated the clean room.
Howard: Why do you keep assuming it was me?
Leonard: Because you do this kind of thing all the time, and then you try to cover it up.
Howard: Like when?
Leonard: What about when you flipped the Mars Rover, or lost Koothrappalis dog, or almost drove off with that baby?
Howard: Again, it looked like my car, and the baby didnt even cry until his mother punched me with her keys.
Leonard: Fine, put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag.
Howard: Well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?
Leonard: I can try, but your plan has the words garbage bag and Slim Jim in it.
Raj: Hey, whats going on?
Leonard: Oh. Genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim.
Raj: Should have put it in the bag first.
Scene: Amys apartment.
Penny: So, if you dont mind me asking, do you think you might start dating again?
Dr Koothrappali: Its much too soon for that. Why? Do you know someone?
Penny: No, but if things dont work out with me and Leonard, Ill give you a call. Wait. How much do you talk about Star Trek?
Amy: Okay, lets get this Victorian party started. Ive done some research about some traditional parlour games we can play.
Penny: Like what?
Amy: Well, theres a fun one called Ball of Wool. You take a ball of wool, and you put it right in the centre of the table. Then people sit on opposite sides of the table and try to blow the wool off.
Penny: Sorry. Shes taken, too.
Scene: The clean room.
Howard: You know what I think your problem is? Youre jealous because you and I used to be best friends until Koothrappali came along.
Leonard: And you found somebody you could push around?
Raj: Hey.
Howard: Stay out of this.
Raj: Okay.
Howard: You know, maybe Im best friends with Raj because he doesnt think hes smarter than me.
Raj: Actually.
Howard: I said, stay out of it.
Leonard: No, no, no. No, Raj, go ahead, say what you were gonna say.
Raj: All Im gonna say is you guys need to stop this right now. It. its bad enough that my parents are fighting, now I have to hear the two of you? And who cares whos smarter? If its Leonard or me or, you know, its Christmas, lets say its Howard.
Howard: Well, if youre so smart, you get the bird out.
Raj: No, youre the one who let him in.
Howard: How do you know it wasnt Leonard?
Raj: Come on.
Scene: A shopping mall.
Bernadette: What about that sweater?
Sheldon: No, its not good enough. It has to be perfect.
Bernadette: I think the nicest gifts Ive got from Howie show how well he knows me.
Sheldon: Hmm. Lets see, what do I know about Amy? She loves medieval literature, Chaucers her favourite. And her eyes sparkle when she watches old French movies. I enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance as if shes playing along.
Bernadette: Wow, you really do love her.
Sheldon: I do. Now, lets find the kind of gift that makes her feel small and worthless.
Scene: Amys apartment. 
Amy: You won.
Penny: Certainly doesnt feel like it, does it?
Dr Koothrappali: You know, my wife used to throw theme parties like this all the time.
Penny: Oh, I guess thats where Raj gets it from.
Dr Koothrappali: Well, he and his mother spent a lot of time together when he was young. I was always working.
Penny: Hey, you know, Raj is dating a doctor who works a lot. Him and his mom have a type. You, you got to laugh at that, right? No? All right.
Scene: Santas grotto. 
Santa: All right, let me see if Ive got this straight. A picture of you on my lap is a way to punish your girlfriend for making you celebrate Christmas?
Sheldon: Correct.
Santa: Santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough.
Sheldon: Theres an argument for that. But I want to make sure.
Photographer: Smile.
Santa: Ho, ho. ho.
Scene: The clean room.
Leonard: Okay. On the count of three, Ill shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out.
Howard: Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?
Leonard: Do you want the fire extinguisher?
Howard: Yeah, I do.
Leonard: Great. Here you go.
Howard: Okay. One, two, three.
Raj: Uh, you have to take the pin out.
Leonard: You miss the blanket now, dont you?
Howard: On three. One, two, three.
Raj: What did you do?
Howard: It was an accident. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Leonard: Relax, it wasnt your fault.
Howard: Uh, maybe its just stunned.
Raj: Dude, its not breathing.
Howard: Oh, no. I killed it. Oh, not again.
Raj: What do you mean, not again?
Howard: When I was ten, I was playing in my backyard and sat on a blue jay. I mean, I tried to bring it back to life with electricity, but it just caught on fire. The worst part was it smelled delicious.
Leonard: Uh, guys, I found an article here that says you can do CPR on birds.
Howard: Great. Do it.
Leonard: Im not doing it. You killed him, you do it.
Raj: Ill do it.
Howard: No. I need to do it. This is on me.
Leonard: Okay. Mouth over beak and light chest compressions.
Raj: Dont blow too hard. If you pop him, I will vomit.
Leonard: Anything?
Howard: I am tasting a lot of Slim Jim.
Leonard: Wait, wait, his wing moved.
Howard: Oh, he blinked his eyes. Hes alive.
Raj: Its a Christmas miracle.
Howard: I might argue a Hanukkah miracle, but Ill take it. Come on, little guy, lets get you outside. Get the curtain.
Raj: Someone should really close that loading door.
Scene: The same, later.
Raj: Well, thats that. The rooms compromised. Theyll have to change all the filters, probably shut it down for weeks.
Howard: You were right. Go ahead, call Building Services. Tell them it was my fault.
Leonard: No, were both to blame. You know, let me take the heat on this one.
Raj: Yeah, just leave me out of it. You know if they come here and see crap everywhere, theyre just gonna blame the Indian guy.
Leonard (on phone): Hey. Im sorry, were still here. Is everything okay?
Penny: Its kind of boring. Although it did get exciting for a minute when Amy inhaled a wool ball. How much longer do you think youll be?
Leonard: I dont know. Theres still a bird in here. We are gonna get in a ton of trouble.
Penny: Honey, its Christmas Eve. Who even knows youre in there?
Leonard: No, our names are on the sign-in sheet.
Penny: So erase them and walk out.
Leonard: I cant do that.
Howard: Cant do what?
Leonard: She says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave.
Howard: We cant do that.
Leonard: Yeah.
Scene: Leonards car.
Leonard, Howard and Raj (singing): Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey.
Scene: Amys apartment. 
Raj: Mmm. Amy, that pudding was delicious.
Sheldon: If you like raisins.
Amy: Thank you. And its figs.
Sheldon: Oh. Oh, in that case, it was pretty good.
Bernadette: You feeling okay? You hardly touched your goose.
Howard: It smelled too much like blue jay.
Dr Koothrappali: Can I help you clean up?
Amy: Oh, you Heimliched a ball of wool out of me; youre good.
Sheldon: Uh, what do you say we exchange gifts?
Penny: Oh, Sheldon, we didnt bring any.
Leonard: I thought you hate giving gifts.
Sheldon: Yeah, I do. Which is why I got Amy this.
Amy: You got me something?
Sheldon: Oh, not just something, no. Its from the heart, its holiday-themed, and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it.
Amy: Look at you on Santas lap. Thats so sweet.
Sheldon: Of course it is. Its the perfect gift. How are you feeling right now? Guilty? Sad? Wishing you were Jewish?
Amy: No, I love it.
Sheldon: Oh, really? Well, how about now? (On recording) Happy holidays to my dear Amy. I hope you treasure this as much as I treasure you. (Not on recording) And you got me nothing. Christmas is ruined. Lets never speak of it again. Well, this was fun.
Amy: Actually, I did get you something.
Sheldon: But what about our agreement?
Amy: Well, you got me something. Here.
Sheldon: Cookies?
Amy: Theyre your Meemaws Christmas cookies. I called and got the recipe.
Sheldon: Theyre perfect. It tastes like her hugs.
Amy: Merry Christmas, Sheldon.
Sheldon: I cant believe this. Youre happy, Im happy. Well, maybe a holiday thats all about giving isnt so Get your hand out of that box.
Scene: The same, later.
Amy: Okay. The next game is called Hot Boiled Beans.
Penny: Of course it is.
Amy: One person is sent out of the room while the others hide a small item. Then they invite the first person back by saying hot boiled beans and bacon for supper, hurry up before it gets cold.
Raj: If you people think this is better than Tom Hanks-giving, youre all crazy.
