Scene: The stairwell
Raj: Hey, want to spend some time playing the new Star Wars game this weekend?
Leonard: Oh, I dont know. I kind of promised myself Id get off the computer, be more physically active. Get some exercise.
Howard: Youre about to walk up three flights of stairs.
Leonard: Good point, Im in.
Raj: You know what would be great? Lets do it like the old days.
Leonard: You mean, are you talking gaming marathon?
Raj: Yeah. Start Saturday morning, go 48 hours, sleeping bags, junk food.
Howard: Turn off our phones so our moms cant call.
Leonard: It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago when the neighbours called the cops on us.
Howard: They called the cops because of the smell. They thought we were dead.
Raj: We were badass back in the day.
Leonard: All right, lets do it.
Howard: 48 hours of Star Wars gaming.
Raj: Its on like Alderaan.
Leonard: Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend. Starting Saturday morning, Star Wars< marathon
Raj: Woo-hoo!
Sheldon: Movies or video games? Or board game? Or trading card games? Or Legos? Or dress up? Or comic books? Or dramatic readings of novelizations? Yes to all!
Leonard: We are going to play the online game.
Sheldon: The online game? Bully!
Amy: Gentlemen, as much as Im sure Sheldon would enjoy playing intergalactic make-believe, he and I have other plans. We are attending my Aunt Floras 93rd birthday party.
Sheldon: Just tell her I cant come.
Amy: Shell be disappointed if we dont show up.
Sheldon: Shes 93. She wont be disappointed for very long.
Amy: No, hang on. I followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement. I made a written record request 72 hours in advance. I checked the tyre pressure on the car. I even contacted the Centres For Disease Control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County. FYI, its none.
Sheldon: Amy, the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way.
Amy: You use it to get your way.
Sheldon: I use it to get the right way. The fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence.
Amy: You gave me your word. Youre coming with me.
Leonard: Well miss you, Sheldon.
Sheldon: Yeah, well, who wants to spend the whole weekend, running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters. Thats for babies.
Howard: Yeah, but its got lightsabres.
Sheldon: Yeah, please, Amy! Its got lightsabres!
Credits sequence.
Scene: The comic book store.
Sheldon: Hello Stuart.
Stuart: Hey Sheldon. Help you with anything?
Sheldon: Yes. Im attending a party this weekend, for a 93-year-old woman. Can you recommend a gift?
Stuart: Uh, I dont know. Could put a tennis ball on the end of Excalibur. Make a pretty badass cane.
Sheldon: Do you supply the the tennis ball?
Stuart: No.
Sheldon: Then no. What else?
Stuart: Hmm. Oh, have this collectors edition Batman utility belt. Maybe she can use it as a wearable pill caddy.
Sheldon: Well, shed just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume.
Stuart: Im sorry Sheldon, thats it. Thats all I got.
Sheldon: Oh, its not your fault. Ive been to the model train store. Ive been to Radio Shack. This woman is impossible to shop for.
Leonard: Id make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems if I wasnt in shock that Sheldon has girl problems.
Sheldon: No, Leonard, go ahead and mock. Like my daddy always said, Shelly, women arent anything but flippin pains in the bottom.
Leonard: Thats what your father used to say?
Sheldon: Well, I took out the bad words and the yeehaw, but you get the gist.
Howard: Look, if you dont want to go to the party, just dont go. Youre a grown man. Act like one. Tell Amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover and playing video games with your friends. Maybe shell dig it. Women like a firm hand on the tiller.
Raj: I can never find the tiller. I got a book; it didnt help.
Sheldon: Yeah, I always thought if I were ever enslaved, it would be by an advanced species from another planet, not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale.
Howard: Now, I downloaded an app that might be helpful in this situation. (Phone makes whip sound)
Sheldon: Youre right. Im smart as a whip. I should be able to figure this out.
Scene: Pennys apartment.
Leonard: Hey, listen, I kind of made plans with the guys this weekend, but then I wondered, because were in this relationship-beta-test, if I should have asked you first. Then I thought if I did check with you first, youd think that I was taking things to seriously. And then, then I got a nosebleed.
Penny: You dont have to check with me. Do whatever you want.
Leonard: Oh. I guess I was hoping for a different reaction, but okay.
Penny: Really, what were you hoping for?
Leonard: I dont know, maybe that youd be a little upset, and then youd realize that Im a stallion that has to run free. And that would turn you on a little.
Penny: Okay, Im an actress. Ask me again.
Leonard: Do you mind if I spend the weekend playing video games with the guys?
Penny: Whu the entire weekend? You mean I wouldnt see you at all? But I ju No, no, I knew what I was getting into. You cant put a saddle on Leonard Hofstadter. Oh, my, is it getting hot in here? Ay, papi.
Leonard: Ay papi? What is that?
Penny: An acting choice.
Leonard: Oh. So you chose that when you become turned on, you turn into Speedy Gonzalez?
Penny: Choo got a problem with that, papi?
Leonard: Uh-uh.
Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Penny!
Penny: Sorry, Stallion. Your weird friend Giraffe is here.
Sheldon: Hello, Penny. I just stopped by to bring you this gift.
Penny: Gummy bears? Thank you.
Sheldon: Now that youre in my debt, please manipulate Amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her aunts tedious birthday party.
Penny: Not a chance.
Sheldon: All right. I thought the candy might not be enough so let me up the ante. These are Cooper Coupons. These are for various things I can do for you. Um, oh, this one is for one free grammar check. Uh, you could use it for emails, letters, tattoos, what have you. Um, oh, this is fun one. This is an afternoon with me at the California Science Center, where I point out their mistakes.
Leonard: Keep an eye on those expiration dates, Ive been burned more than once.
Penny: All right, sweetie, Im not going to get involved in your relationship.
Sheldon: Oh, come on. Its just a simple favour. Now, whens the last time I asked you to do something for me?
Penny: Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
Sheldon: When is the last time I asked you to do something that wasnt a medical emergency?
Penny: Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
Sheldon: All right, then, I have no choice but to go on to plan B.
Penny: Whats that?
Sheldon: Im going to run around outside with a wet head and try to catch a cold.
Scene: Amys car.
Amy: Good morning.
Sheldon: Hello.
Amy: I think youre really going to enjoy yourself today. Not only do you get to meet my relatives, but since my aunts nursing home is catering the party, all of the food is incredibly soft. Its like a vacation for your teeth.
Sheldon: All right.
Amy: You sure youre okay with this?
Sheldon: Yes. I decided to find a way that I could have this experience and enjoy it.
Amy: Thank you. That means a lot to me.
Sheldon: Oh, dont thank me. Thank wireless technology. I realized, I can go to your aunts awful party and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends.
Amy: Sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you, and youre going to be sitting there playing a game? Isnt that a little rude?
Sheldon: Oh, I got that covered. Headset. I wont hear a word the old geezers are saying.
Amy: You know, if playing that game is more important to you than honouring your commitment to me, and you dont mind me showing up at a party all by myself after Ive already told everybody Ill be bringing somebody, then, fine. Go home and play your game.
Sheldon: Thanks. Ooh, listen, I wouldnt mind a piece of birthday cake, provided the old gals candle blow is clean and dry.
Scene: The apartment.
Raj: Here you go. Ive got everything well need for the big game. Low fat turkey jerky, low-carb beer, 100-calorie snack packs.
Leonard: You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there? You might be short one.
Raj: Hey, I plan on levelling up in the game, not my swimsuit size, thank you very much.
Sheldon: Gentlemen, the game offers us a choice between playing for the Republic and the light side, or the Sith Empire and the dark side.
Leonard: Well, were always the good guys. In D&D, were lawful good, in City Of Heroes, were the heroes, in Grand Theft Auto, we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat.
Sheldon: Those women are prostitutes? You said they were raising money for stem cell research.
Howard: Hey, guys, I got a surprise.
Leonard: Uh, if its yoghurt that helps ladies poop, I think Raj beat you to it.
Howard: No. Bernadettes going to be playing with us. So, thats pretty cool, huh? Right? Sure it is, yeah.
Raj: What, you invited your girlfriend? This is supposed to be our weekend.
Howard: I had no choice. Last night, she said, why dont we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the Arboretum. And I said, well, no, I promised the guys I was going to play a video game with them all weekend. And she said, that sounds like fun, can I come, too? And then I didnt answer for a second, and then she said, well, do you not want me to come? And then I bought her a new laptop and the game, and shes parking the car right now.
Sheldon: Is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?
Leonard: Uh, it is, but I think you mightve waited too long for it to be funny. (Whip sound) I was wrong, its still funny.
Sheldon: Oh, good. Hah-hah!
Scene: Pennys apartment.
Penny: Amy, whats wrong?
Amy: My boyfriends a jerk.
Penny: Well, I know he didnt cheat on you, so what happened?
Amy: I had to go to my aunts party all by myself, and everybody was like, wheres this boyfriend youre always talking about? Is he real, or did you make him up like Armin the miniature horse breeder?
Penny: Whos Armin the miniature horse breeder?
Amy: The pretend boyfriend I invented to get my family off my back. It unravelled quickly when I couldnt answer the question howd you two meet?
Penny: I would have thought at a miniature horse show.
Amy: Oh, thats good.
Penny: Mm.
Amy: I panicked and said Woodstock. I just wanted to show Sheldon off to my family.
Penny: Sure, I get that. I mean, hes your first boyfriend and all.
Amy: Not just my first boyfriend, hes the best boyfriend. I mean, think about it. Im dating Sheldon Cooper.
Penny: Yes. On purpose.
Amy: Hes handsome, hes lanky, hes brilliant, and his skin has that pale, waxy quality.
Penny: Well, sickly is the new sexy.
Amy: Yeah.
Penny: Mm. You know, Amy, sometimes when youre in a relationship with someone you really care about, the sucky part is, it leaves you open to getting hurt.
Amy: Do you ever worry about Leonard doing that to you?
Penny: Thats hilarious. No.
Scene: The apartment.
Bernadette: Get that guy! Get that guy! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!
Sheldon: Dr. Rostenkowski, it may interest you to know that saying pew, pew, pew isnt as effective as pressing your blaster key. In the same way that saying whee doesnt make the land speeder go.
Bernadette: Pew!
Leonard: Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail.
Raj: Got him. When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence, I bet he didnt know how much fun it was killing stuff.
Leonard: All right, I think we got them all. Lets divide up the loot.
Bernadette: Ooh, look at this pretty purple robe I just got. You should put on yours and then well match.
Howard: But I worked hard to get this armour.
Bernadette: Sorry, I just thought itd be nice if people knew we were a couple.
Howard: Fine, Ill change. (Whip sound) 
Sheldon: Hah-hah!
Scene: Pennys apartment.
Amy: I dont think I want to play a game.
Penny: Oh, come on. Theyre playing one across the hall, we should, too. Okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table, and if it goes into this cup, the other person has to drink. Then you get to go again
Amy: Like that?
Penny: Wow. Yeah, b-beginners luck. So, now I will drink this entire cup of beer, and you will go again and we can uh all right. So, yeah, okay, now Im gonna drink this entire cup and then Im going to drink another one Okay, seriously, stop. What the hell?
Amy: Spent a lot of my childhood throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends. At a certain point, you start doing trick shots just to keep things interesting.
Penny: Whoa, whoa, give me a second to catch up here. Hold on. (Sound of cheering)
Amy: Thatd be my boyfriend. Happier playing his dopey Star Trek game with his friends than hanging out with me.
Penny: Wars.
Amy: What?
Penny: Star Wars. They get all cranky when you mix the two up.
Amy: Whats the difference?
Penny: Theres absolutely no difference.
Amy: How do I get him to treat me better?
Penny: All right. Let me give you a little girlfriend 101. Usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold sex, but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty. So, Id say give him the silent treatment.
Amy: No, he loves that.
Penny: Hmm.
Amy: Our record for sitting in a room together and not speaking to each other is six-and-a half hours. He said it was a magical evening.
Penny: All right, then were gonna have to go with an oldie but goodie, making a scene.
Amy: I dont think Id be good at that.
Penny: Thats why youre lucky to have me. Back in Omaha, there are two different restaurants Im not allowed into. Both Chilis.
Scene: The apartment.
Raj: Bernadette, remember, your characters the healer in our group. Youre in charge of healing all of us, not just Howard.
Bernadette: I cant help it. My Howie Wowie has an owie.
Sheldon: That is the most sickeningly sweet thing I have ever experienced. And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine.
Amy (bursting in): Sheldon Cooper, Ive got a bone to pick with you, and Im about to do it in front of all your friends.
Penny: Yeah, you pick that bone. You pick that bone clean!
Amy: Im gonna publicly shame you, and then sit back as societal pressure compels you to modify your behaviour.
Penny: Ooh, burn!
Amy: And if you dont start treating me better, Im leaving you for a miniature horse breeder named Armin.
Sheldon: Armin who?
Amy: Armin damn it.
Penny: Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family, and you stood her up, okay? Look at this adorable, smushy face. Smush, smush, smush, smush.
Amy: Youre hurting me.
Penny: No, Sheldon hurt you.
Amy: Before; now its you.
Penny: Oh.
Sheldon: I think I understand. Youre the one person who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend, but that rings hollow if you cant lord him over others in the flesh. I forget what I bring to the party and what I take away when I leave. Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons as restitution.
Penny: Sheldon, she doesnt want your stupid
Amy: Ooh, Science Center. Redeeming. Lets go.
Sheldon: Well played, Amy Farrah Fowler. Let me get my coat. (Whip sound) Oh, grow up, Leonard.
Raj: But e-excuse me, I have something to say. None of you may realize it, but I was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was gonna be like the old days, the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. Do you have any idea what its like to be the only one without a girlfriend? Even if I get one someday, Ill still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!
Penny: And thats how a girl makes a scene. Im sorry, sweetie. Youre right. You deserve your weekend. Come on, Amy, lets go.
Amy: What about the Science Center?
Penny: Ill let you hold my hair while I throw up.
Amy: Rain check.
Bernadette: Im gonna go, too.
Howard: Ill miss you.
Bernadette: Ill miss you.
Howard: Ill miss you more.
Bernadette: No, Ill
Raj: Just leave! Okay, now. This is the way its supposed to be. Men together, fighting the forces of evil.
All: Hear! Hear!
Raj: I cant believe this is only 64 calories.
Scene: Some time later. The guys are asleep.
Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard Joel Wolowitz! Ive been worried sick for two days, and I know you turned off your phone! You open up this door right now because Ive had it up to here! I have been to the morgue and the hospital, and I spent the last half hour walking up these ferkakta stairs!
Howard: Thats my ride, got to go. (Whip sound)
