Scene: The apartment.
Sheldon: Gentlemen, Star Wars Day is rapidly approaching. We should finalize our plans.
Penny: What? Thats a real thing? What is it, Star Wars Christmas?
Howard: No. Dont be ridiculous. Thats Wookiee Life Day.
Penny: So, when is it?
Leonard: Uh, well, its not May the fifth, and its not May the third. Its May the fourth.
Sheldon: Get it?
Raj: May the fourth be with you?
Leonard: May the force be with you. Get it?
Penny: Oh, no. This face wasnt because I didnt get it.
Credits sequence.
Scene: Sheldons bedroom. There is a knock on the door.
Sheldon: Come in.
Leonard: Hey, you got a second?
Sheldon: Yes. Actually, Im glad youre here. Im working on the Star Wars Day schedule. Now, I have a window built in after Phantom Menace for complaining, but Im worried an hour wont be enough time.
Leonard: Sheldon, Ive got some bad news.
Sheldon: What is it?
Leonard: I just read online that Arthur Jeffries passed away.
Sheldon: Professor Proton is dead?
Leonard: Sorry, buddy.
Sheldon: What are you doing?
Leonard: Comforting you?
Sheldon: Your heart might be in the right place, but your head, chest and arms certainly arent.
Leonard: Anyway, the, the funerals on Sunday.
Sheldon: But, thats Star Wars Day.
Leonard: Yeah, um, of all the things about this that are sad, that might not be number one. You okay? I know he meant a lot to you.
Sheldon: Im fine.
Leonard: Okay. Yet he cried when they changed the Raisin Bran box.
Scene: Amys apartment. 
Professor Proton (on youtube): This, uh, this is something interesting boys and girls. After an owl eats, he spits up part of his meal that he cant digest, in the form of a pellet. Is, isnt that a hoot? Well be right back after I fire my writers. (Owl hoots) Oh, shut up.
Amy: Watching your old friend?
Sheldon: Hmm. Yes. Look at him, Amy. Its such a shame. Struck down in the prime of my life.
Amy: Do you want me to go to the funeral with you?
Sheldon: Oh, Im not going to the funeral.
Amy: Why not?
Sheldon: All those people blowing their noses. You cant tell the sick from the sad. Mm. Ill be at home celebrating Star Wars Day, as planned.
Amy: Are you sure you dont want to go say good-bye?
Sheldon: Amy, mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time.
Amy: And watching a bunch of goofy space movies youve seen hundreds of times isnt?
Sheldon: If we were in a physical relationship, you just lost sex tonight.
Scene: The apartment.
Penny: Hey, guys.
Raj: Hey, Penny. Happy Star Wars Day.
Penny: Okay.
Raj: Can I make you breakfast? Admiral Ackbars Snack Bar is open for business.
Penny: No, thanks. Leonard and I are just going to the funeral.
Howard: You sure. Not even coffee? We have R2-Decaf. Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?
Raj: And if youre not in the mood for coffee I can always make you a Chai Tea-3PO.
Penny: Oh, I get it, like C3PO. What happened to me?
Raj: Hey, uh, Sheldon, you want anything?
Sheldon: Uh, no, thank you.
Howard: Youre being so quiet. Are you upset or are you just rebooting?
Sheldon: Im fine.
Penny: Sweetie, are you sure you dont want to come with us to the funeral?
Sheldon: Oh, I appreciate the offer, but Arthur is gone and theres nothing I can do about it. When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan, did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?
Penny: No, he blew up the Death Star. Why do I know this?
Sheldon: Arthur Jeffries was a scientist. Im sure he didnt care about silly superstitions like funerals. You know, if he were here, I think hed say enjoy Star Wars Day.
Leonard: He was 84, hed say wheres my pudding?
Raj: Before you go, at least let me pack you some Attack of the Scones for the road.
Penny: Oh, like Attack of the Clones. We are leaving right now.
Scene: Amys apartment. 
Amy: Arthur passing away was harder on Sheldon than hes ready to admit. Really hoping this will cheer him up.
Bernadette: Me, too. Although, it mightve been thoughtless of us to bake a Death Star cake.
Amy: No, it combines two of Sheldons favorite things, chocolate chips and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button.
Bernadette: Well, anyway, itll be a nice surprise for the boys. And Howie doesnt think I take his interests seriously, so hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while.
Amy: Okay, lets get the fondant and start decorating.
Bernadette: This is pretty cool. You dont see too many spherical cakes.
Amy: I wonder why that is.
Scene: The funeral.
Penny: I have a confession to make.
Leonard: Hmm?
Penny: Ive never been to a funeral before.
Leonard: Really?
Penny: I just never knew anyone that died. I had a pet pig when I was a kid. I mean, when he died, we didnt have a funeral, we had a barbecue.
Leonard: Yeah, we wont be eating Arthur tonight.
Penny: I didnt know him very well, but I still really liked him. Its weird that hes just gone.
Leonard: I know.
Penny: I feel like I want to cry.
Leonard: Oh thats, thats fine. Go ahead.
Penny: I cant do it with you staring at me.
Leonard: Sorry.
Penny: No, Im dry. Youre a big crybaby, you start, Ill join in.
Leonard: I am not a crybaby.
Penny: Toy Story 3?
Leonard: The toys were holding hands in a furnace. Look, Arthur lived a full life. And he inspired a lot of people. Sure, he, he was my childhood hero, but the fact that I got to work with him, side by side, before he died was, it was, it was a gift.
Penny: It was a gift. Thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship.
Leonard: I got your back.
Penny: Yeah.
Scene: The apartment. 
Sheldon: Okay, here we go. Episode I: The Phantom Menace.
Raj: Ugh, lets get this over with.
Howard: Since we all agree Episode I isnt our favourite, maybe we just skip it this time.
Sheldon: Howard, I think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it.
Raj: You know, I heard of this way of watching the movies called the Machete Order, where you watch Episodes IV and V, then skip Episode I, watch II and III as a flashback, and then finish with VI.
Howard: Okay, so youd lose most of Jar Jar, all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings, which are like watching C-SPAN with monsters.
Sheldon: Get rid of the trade route part? Then how would Palpatine get Chancellor Valorum kicked out of office? How would he get himself elected? How? Can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous?
Raj: It was just a suggestion.
Sheldon: Well, you know what else was just a suggestion? Why dont we change the Raisin Bran box? Hmm? And you know who got hurt by that? Every single person who eats breakfast.
Raj: Wow.
Howard: I think hes taking this Professor Proton thing pretty hard.
Raj: Should we try to console him?
Howard: Or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief?
Raj: By staying here and watching the movie.
Howard: Thats what good friends would do.
Scene: Later.
Howard: Well, at least without Sheldon here, we got to start with Episode IV.
Raj: Mm, true. I do feel guilty about him.
Howard: Me, too.
Raj: Maybe we should see how hes doing.
Howard: Yeah.
Raj: But after the cantina scene.
Howard: Obviously.
Scene: Sheldon, dreaming he is in the living room of the apartment on his laptop.
Sheldon: Look at Arthur, cracking up at a joke I told him. Ill never hear that laugh again.
Arthur: You never heard it that time.
Sheldon: Arthur. I thought you were dead.
Arthur: I am. Oh, it, its fantastic. I mean this, this is the longest that Ive gone without running into a mens room in, in, in years.
Sheldon: Why are you here?
Arthur: I dont know. I was, I was hoping I was going to haunt my ex-wife.
Sheldon: I know why. Youve come to me because youre my Obi-Wan.
Arthur: Im, Im not, Im not familiar with that. Is, is, is that an, an Internet?
Sheldon: Wow. Uh, youre dead, so Im going to let that slide. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character from Star Wars. After his physical demise, he comes to Luke Skywalker as his mentor in spirit form.
Arthur: Well, that, that clears that up.
Sheldon: You must be here to give me advice.
Arthur: Well, this, this is weird. Most, most of my robes open in, in the back.
Sheldon: Those are your Jedi robes.
Arthur: Oh, wait. What, what, what is, what is this?
Sheldon: Be careful with that.
Arthur: Oh. Oh. Oh, neato. Im, uh, Im going to need a Band-Aid.
Scene: The funeral.
Leonard: So, what did you think of your first funeral?
Penny: Well, I dont want to be a jerk, but it was kind of a bummer.
Leonard: Yeah, well, when I die, you can rent a bounce house.
Penny: You think about dying?
Leonard: Mm. Well, I think more about if Id have any regrets.
Penny: What would you regret?
Leonard: Mm, you know, that I didnt travel more, take more risks, learn another language.
Penny: You know Klingon.
Leonard: Thats true.
Penny: No, I meant that as a regret.
Leonard: I just thought of one more.
Penny: Whats that?
Leonard: I regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you.
Penny: Well, it just wasnt the right time.
Leonard: Yeah.
Penny: And this is also not the right time. Do not propose.
Leonard: What?
Penny: I know that face. Thats your propose face.
Leonard: I was not gonna propose. Its already two to one.
Penny: Whats two to one?
Leonard: I proposed twice, you proposed once. Two to one.
Penny: Oh, my. Its not a contest.
Leonard: I dont know what youre upset about. Im the one whos losing.
Penny: Okay. Fine. Would you feel better if I propose so you could turn me down again?
Leonard: Yeah, I think I would.
Penny: Okay. Leonard, will you marry me?
Leonard: Hmm.
Penny: No, dont you dare. You reject me right now and tie things up.
Leonard: Its just such a big decision. I dont want to have any regrets.
Scene: Amys apartment.
Amy: Did you ever watch Professor Proton when you were a kid?
Bernadette: No. My dad controlled the TV, so unless someone was a Texas Ranger, Jake or the Fatman, we didnt see it.
Amy: I never watched him, either, but he seems to be the reason that Sheldon got interested in science.
Bernadette: Not me. I got into science cause I was always the smallest kid in school, so I thought if I became a scientist, I could invent a formula that made me taller.
Amy: Thats cute.
Bernadette: Yeah, I thought it was working for a while, but then I found out my brother was just lowering the pencil marks on the door frame. How about you?
Amy: Oh, I guess it must have been back when I was in the Girl Sprouts.
Bernadette: Girl Sprouts?
Amy: My mom made it up as an alternative to the Girl Scouts. She didnt want me selling cookies on some street corner like a whore.
Bernadette: How did that get you into science?
Amy: Oh, I went to the library and took out a book on biology to see what whores did.
Scene: Leonards car.
Leonard: On the one hand, if I say yes
Penny: This isnt funny anymore. Just say no so were done with this. Will you marry me or not?
Leonard: Ooh, interesting. Did you just propose to me again?
Penny: No.
Leonard: Really? Because I just heard will you marry me? Thats two proposals, one day. Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter.
Penny: You know what? Fine. Do whatever you want.
Leonard: Hey. Penny, dont get upset. Here. I love you, but, no, I will not marry you.
Penny: Thank you.
Leonard: Now, about that second proposal. On the one hand
Scene: Sheldons dream.
Arthur: Where, where, where are we?
Sheldon: This is the swampland of Dagobah. Its where Luke was trained in the ways of the Jedi.
Arthur: Oh. Too bad. I thought it was Florida.
Sheldon: When Obi-Wan came to Luke on this very spot, he gave him all sorts of helpful advice. So, um, what do you got for me?
Arthur: Um, always, get, get a prenup.
Sheldon: Thats it? I thought thered be more of a reason why youre here.
Arthur: Well, why, why do you think Im here?
Sheldon: I suppose it has something to do with your recent passing.
Arthur: Is, is this the, the first time youve lost, you know, someone close to you?
Sheldon: Oh, no. No. Ive already had to say good-bye to 11 Dr. Whos.
Arthur: Yeah, Ive, Ive outlived a few of my doctors, too.
Sheldon: Of course, my grandfather died when I was five. My father died when I was 14.
Arthur: Im, Im sorry about that.
Sheldon: And now youre gone, too. Its like all the men Ive looked up to have gone away.
Arthur: Well, you know, its, its okay to, to be sad about them. Just, just make sure, you know, you appreciate those who, who are still there for you.
Sheldon: But I do appreciate them.
Arthur: Well, then, what am I doing in a swamp dressed like Friar Tuck? Appreciate them, Sheldon. (Sheldon is woken up by a knocking on his bedroom door.)
Leonard: Hey, buddy. Heard youre having a rough day. You all right?
Sheldon: Im okay. How was the funeral?
Leonard: It was nice, you know. A lot of people showed up, told some great stories about him. Did you know that Arthurs son is a high school sci? (Sheldon hugs him) Hey, the guys are about to start Jedi. You want to go watch?
Sheldon: I do. After I make them go back and watch one through five first.
Leonard: Sheldon, that, thatll take us all night.
Sheldon: Thats true. Oh, its a good thing I had a nap.
Scene: The apartment. 
Howard: Boy, some of the physical comedy with Jar Jar is a little tough to watch.
Leonard: At least they toned him down in the second one.
Penny: Yeah, he is pretty stupid.
Raj: Hey, we can say it. You cant.
Amy: Hey, guys.
Bernadette: Happy Star Wars Day.
Sheldon: Wow. A Death Star cake.
Amy: Yeah. We were hoping it might cheer you up.
Bernadette: And even though it meant we had to miss the movies, we could still be part of the fun.
Howard: Well, you didnt miss anything. We just started over.
Bernadette: Son of a bitch.
Scene: The same, everyone is falling asleep.
Sheldon: Youre back.
Arthur: Yeah, apparently, um, Im here whenever, when, whenever you need me.
Sheldon: Thats nice.
Arthur: May, maybe for you.
Sheldon: Why do I need you now?
Arthur: Well, as near as I could tell, you, you fell asleep watching Star Wars, and now youre, youre dreaming youre watching Star Wars.
Sheldon: So?
Arthur: I mean, dont, dont you see a problem there? I mean, how, how youre spending your limited time on Earth?
Sheldon: Not at all.
Arthur: Okay, good luck to you.
