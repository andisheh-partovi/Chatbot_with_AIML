Scene: The apartment.
Leonard: The interface is pretty simple. You put your horizontal X coordinate here, vertical Y coordinate here. When youre happy with those, you press this button.
Penny: Got it.
Sheldon: Leonard, youll never guess who I just found online. Hey!
Leonard: Nice shot.
Penny: Eh, his giant head did most of the work.
Sheldon: Very mature. Youre lucky Im out of silly string. As I was saying, Leonard, youll never guess who I just found online. Professor Proton.
Leonard: Youre kidding. Hes still alive?
Sheldon: Yes.
Penny: Whos Professor Proton?
Leonard: He was the host of this great Hey!
Penny: Yes! Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton.
Sheldon: Professor Proton hosted my favourite science show when I was a child. I never missed an episode. He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.
Leonard: It was pretty cool.
Penny: Aw, so cute when you use the word cool wrong. Like when kids say pasghetti.
Sheldon: Oh, dear lord, Leonard, look. Hes still available for parties and events. We should hire him.
Leonard: Hire him to do what?
Sheldon: Well, whatever we want. Hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar.
Leonard: It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used awesome wrong, didnt I?
Sheldon: Well, Im e-mailing him right now.
Leonard: Do you remember his old theme song?
Sheldon: Of course I do.
Together: Grab your goggles, put your lab coat on, here he comes, Professor Proton.

Raj: Hey, I just found out I have to be at the telescope lab all weekend. Any chance you and Bernadette could take care of my dog?
Howard: Why dont you put her in a kennel?
Raj: Why dont you put your mother in a home?
Howard: To be honest, shed do better in the kennel. Ill talk to Bernie. Im sure its fine.
Raj: Thank you.
Sheldon: Its happening. Leonard, its happening. Professor Proton is coming to our house.
Leonard: Youre kidding.
Howard: You mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?
Sheldon: And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you Id find a tactful way to do that.
Howard: Howd you get him to come to your house?
Sheldon: As Professor Proton always says, there is no problem you cant solve if you use your noggin.
Leonard: And he wrote him a cheque.
Sheldon: Yeah, that, too. Big cheque.

Howard: Okay, so what do I need to know to take care of her?
Raj: Its very simple. For breakfast, she has an egg-white frittata. Feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an English muffin, but not both. Were watching our weight. Uh, for dinner, something simple, a veal chop, some scampi, whatever you like.

Sheldon (off): Leonard, are you in bed?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon (off): Me, too.
Leonard: Great.
Sheldon (off): I cant sleep.
Leonard: Well, I can, so shut up.
Sheldon (off): Do you realize that in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries, aka Professor Proton, will be in our apartment?
Leonard: Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, youre gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night.
Sheldon (off): Im thinking of wearing a tuxedo.
Leonard: Thats not ridiculous. Good night.
Sheldon (off): Do you have cufflinks?
Leonard: No.

Leonard: What?
Sheldon (off): I still cant sleep.
Scene: Howard and Bernadettes apartment.
Howard: She really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?
Bernadette: Yeah, you two were so cute playing together.
Howard: It was kind of fun throwing a ball and not having anyone laugh at me.
Bernadette: And you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didnt wear out her tiny legs.
Howard: Yeah, thats what I was doing.
Bernadette: You know, there were a few moments today when I almost felt like we were a little family.
Howard: Really?
Bernadette: Yeah. I never thought of myself as a mom, but when the three of us were out there having fun, I felt like maybe someday we could do it.
Howard: Of course we can. Especially if our babys as calm and quiet as little Cinna Son of a bitch, shes gone.
Bernadette: Whered she go?
Howard: I dont know, she didnt leave a note.
Bernadette: Well, you were the one who was supposed to put her back in the stroller.
Howard: No, I wasnt. You were.
Bernadette: No, I wasnt.
Howard: Yes, you were!.
Bernadette: Yeah, well, you throw like a girl.
Scene: The apartment. 
Sheldon: Im getting worried.
Penny: Relax, Sheldon, hes only a few minutes late.
Sheldon: Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know, every day, four oclock, he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case wed join him in progress. (Phone rings) Its him. Hello. Well, I see. Yes. All right, we can come get you. Yeah, well, see you soon. Bye.
Leonard: Where is he?
Sheldon: The third floor landing. The poor old guys been walking up the stairs for half an hour. Its really you.
(On the third floor landing)
Leonard: Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry. We shouldve told you about the broken elevator.
Arthur: I agree.
Sheldon: Professor Proton, its an honour to meet you.
Arthur: Just, just call me Arthur.
Sheldon: Leonard, you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means were friends.
Arthur: No. A friend wouldve, wouldve told me about the elevator.
Sheldon: Look at me. I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying its going to ruin my eyes.
Arthur: Is, uh, is he dangerous?
Leonard: Actually, hes a genius.
Sheldon: I am.
Arthur: That doesnt answer my question.
Leonard: Mr. Jeffries, Im, Im Leonard. This is my girlfriend, Penny.
Arthur: Hi.
Penny: Hello.
Arthur: Well, I hope I havent, uh, kept the kids waiting too long for, for the show.
Sheldon: Oh, no, there are no kids. No, the, the shows for me. Come on. Ill race ya, Arthur.
Arthur: Is the, is the blonde girl really your, your girlfriend?
Leonard: Yes, sir.
Arthur: Youre the genius.
(Back in the Apartment)
Penny: So, do you do a lot of appearances like this?
Arthur: It, its hard to say. Im, Im still trying to figure out what, what th, what this is.
Leonard: We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life.
Arthur: Well, there, there really isnt too much to tell. After the TV show was, was cancelled, nobody in the scientific world would, uh, would take me seriously. So I was forced to do these, uh, childrens parties to, to make a living.
Leonard: Thats too bad. But still, working with kids, it must be rewarding.
Arthur: You, you get bit a lot. Let me see if, if I have this straight. You, you two are, are physicists, and you, and you want me to do a childrens science show?
Sheldon: Yes. And if theres time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.
Arthur: You know, Im a real scientist. I, I have a PhD from Cornell University.
Sheldon: Yeah, thats great. Did you bring your puppet?
Arthur: No, no. I, I hate that puppet.
Sheldon: Oh, no. How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino? Its nice, huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. Including the shipping!
Arthur: Im, Im awake, right? Th, this is happening?
Scene: Bernadettes car.
Bernadette: Cinnamon!
Howard: Cinnamon!
Bernadette: You know, maybe she doesnt recognize her name because of Rajs accent.
Howard: Good thinking. (In a bad Indian accent) Cinnamon, come to Daddy.
Bernadette (likewise): Cinnamon. Where are you, my little lamb chop?
Howard: Nice.
Bernadette: Thanks.
Howard: When this all blows over, remember that voice. Its kind of a turn-on.
Bernadette: It turns you on when I sound like Raj?
Howard: Cinnamon!
Scene: The apartment. 
Arthur: Okay, as, as I put the egg on top, and, and the flame goes out and, and, and the air pressure decreases in, in the flask, what do you think will happen?
Penny: I think I know.
Sheldon: Its gonna get sucked in. Its going to get sucked in.
Penny: Okay, I didnt know.
Sheldon: Yes.
Penny: See, Im not a scientist like them.
Arthur: I, I figured that out.
Sheldon: Potato clock. Do potato clock.
Penny: Whats that?
Arthur: I, I power a clock with a, with a potato.
Penny: Shut up. You can do that? I mean, wouldnt that solve the worlds energy crisis?
Arthur: No. Look, guys, keep your money. I, I think, uh, I, I think Im done.
Sheldon: What, well whats wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away.
Arthur: No, she, shes the only reason Ive, Ive stayed this long.
Leonard: Then what is it?
Arthur: I dont know. I think Im just, I, I just, I just dont want to be Professor Proton any more.
Sheldon: Well, how can you say that? Professor Protons the best.
Arthur: What, what has it ever gotten me? I mean, Im, Im an 83-year-old man who has potatoes in, in his suitcase. Other scientists think, think Im a joke. And the, the puppeteer who did, who did Gino, well, he also did my wife.
Sheldon: Mr. Jeffries, I need to show you something. :14:11,446
Penny: Im sorry to hear about your troubles.
Arthur: Uh, thanks.
Penny: But if you dont mind me asking, uh, the potato clock, how does it work? Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?
Arthur: What do you two talk about?
Sheldon: I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?
Arthur: Ill, Ill give you a hint. I have a bracelet with my own address on it.
Sheldon: Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didnt have any friends growing up.
Arthur: No, I, I get that.
Sheldon: But, um, I did have you. And every day at four oclock, youd come to my house on Channel 68, and wed do science together. If it hadnt been for you, well, who knows what wouldve become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I couldve wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon.
Leonard: I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries.
Sheldon: Yeah, its true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders.
Arthur: Well, thank, thank you, guys. That, that, that means a lot.
Leonard: Its important you know how much you mean to us.
Arthur: Uh-oh.
Penny: Arthur, are you okay?
Arthur: Im having a problem with my pacemaker.
Leonard: Ill, Ill call for help.
Penny: Any chance we could plug it into the potato?
Arthur: No.
Scene: The telescope lab. Rajs phone rings.
Raj: Hello? What do you mean, you found my dog? Shes with my friends. Is she okay? Oh, thank you. Uh, just text me your address, Im on my way. Oh, and if shes hungry, go ahead and feed her. But do not give her anything starchy. Shes having risotto for dinner.
Scene: The apartment.
Paramedic: Your vitals are stable, but lets take you in for some tests just to be safe.
Leonard: You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?
Sheldon: Ill do it.
Arthur: Hes not a relative, hes not allowed, right?
Paramedic: No, thats not a rule. He can go.
Sheldon: Oh, yeah.
Arthur: I cant catch a break today.
Penny: Well pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.
Leonard: Im sorry things turned out this way.
Arthur: Well, at, at this point, Im just glad someones carrying me down the stairs.
Sheldon: Met my childhood hero, now I get to ride in an ambulance. Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, thisll be the best day ever.
Scene: Howard and Bernadettes apartment.
Bernadette: Cant believe we lost her. What was I thinking? Id be a terrible mom.
Howard: Well, maybe with the first one. But kids are like pancakes. The first ones always a throwaway. Hows this look?
Bernadette: Its fine. Whered you get that picture of her?
Howard: Its not her. I just googled foo-foo little dogs. (Skype tone) Its Raj. Stay quiet. Hey, bad timing. Bernadette just took Cinnamon out for a walk.
Raj: Hmm. Interesting. Did they take a walk down Liars Lane?
Howard: What?
Raj: A lane frequented by liars. Like you, you big liar.
Howard: You have her?
Bernadette: Oh, thank God shes okay.
Raj: Well, I trusted you, and you let me down. The poor things been shaking for hours.
Howard: Im really sorry.
Bernadette: Hang on, youve had her for hours?
Raj: Yes. I picked her up, and then we both went for massages to try and calm down. And then we got Pinkberry.
Bernadette: So you knew she was okay, and you couldnt pick up the phone to tell us?
Raj: Well, I, I thought about
Bernadette: Dont well me, mister. Weve been worried sick. She could have been dead for all we knew. You should be ashamed of yourself.
Raj: Sorry. I, I just
Bernadette: Sorrys not good enough. Maybe you need to take some time and think about what youve done.
Howard: Nice guilt trip. You are gonna be an amazing mom.
Scene: A hospital room.
Sheldon: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.
Arthur: Thank you, Sheldon. That, that was very nice.
Sheldon: Want me to sing it again?
Arthur: No. The fourth, the fourth time was, was the charm.
Sheldon: There anything I can get for you? Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?
Arthur: No. No, thank you. But I, I do, I do have a favour to, to ask.
Sheldon: Name it.
Arthur: Well, Im, Im booked to do a childrens party tomorrow, and, um, frankly I, you know, I, I dont feel up to it.
Sheldon: Oh, youre not. You look awful.
Arthur: Thank you. Anyway, uh, I mean, you know my act better than anybody. I was, I was hoping that maybe, you know, maybe youd fill in for me.
Sheldon: Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?
Arthur: Yeah.
Sheldon: Oh, my. What an honour. Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods.
Arthur: Or a Korean family in Alhambra.
Sheldon: But theyll know Im not you. Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?
Arthur: Sounds great.
Sheldon: So, in a way its like Im your son.
Arthur: What, Whatever.
Sheldon: Father.
Arthur: Sure, what the hell.
