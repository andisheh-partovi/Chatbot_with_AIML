Scene: Howard and Bernadettes apartment.
Bernadette: What you doing?
Howard: You said clean up. Im cleaning up.
Bernadette: You cant just throw everything in the closet.
Howard: Hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it, but you cant do both. This isnt sex.
Bernadette: What if someone looks in there?
Howard: Theyre just coming over for dinner. No ones gonna look in the closet.
Bernadette: Well, you dont know that. What if someones looking for the bathroom and they open that door?
Howard: Could work out. For all we know theres a toilet in there somewhere.
Bernadette: Fine. But after tonight we need to get a handle on this mess.
Howard: You know what we should do? We should show the closet to Sheldon.
Bernadette: Why?
Howard: Are you kidding? Hes like a savant at organizing. Everything in his apartment has a label on it. Including his label maker, which has a label that says label maker. And if you look really close at that label maker label, youll see a label that says label.
Bernadette: Hes our guest, we cant just ask him to straighten our closet.
Howard: No, we wouldnt ask him. Wed just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there.
Later.
Howard: Hey, guys, come on in.
All: Hi.
Penny: Ooh, it smells good.
Bernadette: Thanks. And, Sheldon, I know tonights the night you eat Thai food, so I went to the Asian market, got all the ingredients and made it from scratch.
Sheldon: Oh, you shouldnt have.
Bernadette: Oh, its my pleasure.
Sheldon: No, you really shouldnt have. I brought my own.
Bernadette: You stopped and got him takeout?
Leonard: I had no choice. He kept kicking the back of my seat.
Bernadette: Sheldon, Ive been cooking all day.
Sheldon: Well, now dont you feel silly.
Bernadette: Show him the closet.
Credits sequence.
Scene: Howard and Bernadettes apartment.
Raj: These spring rolls are amazing. Good job, Bernadette.
Bernadette: Thats the takeout that Sheldon brought.
Raj: Oh, well, Im sure they wouldnt have tasted nearly as good if I hadnt tried your food first.
Sheldon: Howard, did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour?
Howard: Colours fine.
Sheldon: Wrong, theyll be arranged seasonally.
Penny: Sheldon, arent you gonna spend a little time with Amy?
Amy: Oh, its okay, Im used to it. The other day at Whole Foods, he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle.
Sheldon: Yeah, and some thanks I got. The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami.
Amy: His quirks just make you love him more. Someone please agree with me.
Scene: The closet.
Leonard: Sheldon, come on. Its getting late. Time to go.
Sheldon: Oh, five more minutes.
Leonard: Thats what you said five minutes ago. Amy and Penny are already in the car. Lets move it.
Sheldon: How come I never get to do anything I want to do?
Howard: You know, if he really wants to stay and finish, I can give him a ride home.
Sheldon: Please, Leonard, he said its okay.
Leonard: Sheldon, its, wait, I can go home without you? Bye.
Sheldon: Howard, I have a few questions. I found three bowling pins. Now, do you juggle these, or are you missing seven?
Howard: Juggle.
Sheldon: You health nuts kill me.
Bernadette: Oh, my God, its beautiful. Look, he found the juggling pins I hid.
Sheldon: Uh, just a couple more items. Howard, I found this letter from your dad in a box. Now, based on the content, it could either be filed
Howard: Whoa, you opened this?
Sheldon: Well, I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia. Now, as I was saying, based on the content
Howard: I couldnt be less interested. Now, come on, Ill take you home.
Bernadette: Howard, dont you want to know whats in the letter?
Howard: If I wanted to know, I wouldve opened it years ago. The closet looks great. Lets get out of here.
Sheldon: Wait, can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?
Howard: Do whatever you want.
Sheldon: Thanks. Oh. Great party.
Scene: The stairwell.
Leonard: You know, when I first met Howard, he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts and say, aw, I sat in gum.
Penny: What is your point?
Leonard: Well, its just kind of weird how grown up he is now. Happily married guy throwing dinner parties.
Penny: Really? You couldnt just say that? You had to tell the scrotum story?
Leonard: Trying to paint a picture.
Penny: It was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.
Leonard: Mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too. Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.
Penny: Sure. Just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? Not, like, capes and tights and crap?
Leonard: Yeah. Although
Penny: No.
Scene: Howard and Bernadettes apartment.
Bernadette: Howie, you okay?
Howard: Yeah, I just couldnt sleep.
Bernadette: Told you you shouldnt have espresso after dinner. I know the little cups make you feel big, but its not worth it.
Howard: Its this stupid letter.
Bernadette: Did you read it?
Howard: No.
Bernadette: You must be curious.
Howard: Of course Im curious. I havent seen the man since, oh, I was a little kid. And a letter shows up on my 18th birthday? Whats that about?
Bernadette: Why dont you read it? Maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.
Howard: He abandoned me and my mother. Why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?
Bernadette: I get that. So, what do you want to do with it?
Howard: Something I should have done a long time ago. (Sets fire to it)
Bernadette: Really? Are you sure?
Howard: Yep.
Bernadette: Feel better?
Howard: I do. (Smoke alarm goes off) Great. Neither one of us is tall enough to reach that.
Scene: Pennys apartment.
Amy: I cant believe he set it on fire.
Bernadette: Yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him out. And he was already having a tough day cause he accidentally wore my pants to work. I dont know why he was upset. They were bigger on him than me.
Amy: Boy, Im really curious what was in that letter.
Bernadette: Me, too, but I guess now well never know.
Amy: Well, you said Sheldon read it. Why not ask him?
Bernadette: I cant do that. What kind of wife would I be if I didnt respect my husbands privacy?
Penny: What if I ask Sheldon, you just happen to be in the room?
Bermadette: That works.
Penny: Okay.
Scene: The laundry room.
Sheldon: Bleuch. Like cleaning out the entire buildings belly button.
Penny: Hey, Sheldon.
Sheldon: Oh, hello. What can I do for you ladies?
Amy: You have something we want.
Sheldon: Oh, dear. My mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city.
Penny: No, we just want information.
Sheldon: Oh. Oh, Ive got that in spades. Ravage me.
Penny: We heard you read the letter from Howards father.
Sheldon: I did.
Penny: What did it say?
Sheldon: I cant tell you that. Im bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.
Amy: Sheldon, thats not a real thing.
Sheldon: Well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriends hand at the movies. You know. That doesnt stop you from pawing at me like youre a bear and Im a trash can full of sweets.
Penny: Why do you even care? Just tell us what it says.
Sheldon: Control over the information contained in that letter belongs to Howard. By happenstance, I came to know it. That doesnt give me the right to disseminate it freely.
Penny: Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadettes closet. Doesnt that count for something?
Sheldon: Are you pointing out that California is a community property state, and since Howard and Bernadette are married, the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?
Penny: Yeah, obviously.
Sheldon: Well played. Sometimes I dont give you enough credit, Penny.
Scene: The apartment.
Raj: Dude, you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party.
Leonard: Actually, all I did was invite you.
Raj: Well, put your mind at ease. Im here to make sure your dinner party kicks Howards dinner partys ass. Now, the first thing we need is a theme. Im thinking, ah, turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.
Leonard: Im thinking you need a testosterone patch. Penny and I just want to do something low-key. You know, cocktails, light jazz music, hors doeuvres.
Raj: So your theme is I saw a rerun of Mad Men and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joes? Hate to miss that.
Leonard: Hey, where have you been?
Sheldon: Oh, Leonard. If I was prone to sarcasm, Id say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets.
Leonard: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I meant, golly, Sheldon, youve been gone a long time.
Sheldon: Oh. Yeah, well, I was waylaid by Penny, Bernadette and Amy. They made me reveal confidential information about Howards father.
Leonard: What information?
Sheldon: I cant tell you that. I am bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.
Raj: Well, come on, we wont tell anyone.
Sheldon: Sorry, badgering me wont work. What you should have said is, Its pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us.
Leonard: Fine, then that.
Sheldon: All right, Ill tell you. My goodness, everyones on their game today.
Scene: The apartment kitchen.
Amy: This is really fun.
Raj: Yeah, its nice to get dressed up once in a while.
Penny: Yeah, and the hors doeuvres are delightful.
Leonard: As is the company.
Penny: Aw.
Sheldon: My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.
Leonard: Hey, uh, listen, everybody. Before Howard gets here, ets all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father.
Raj: Of course.
Penny: Sure.
Amy: Absolutely.
Sheldon: If I say yes, can we turn off that Latin orgy music?
Scene: The stairwell.
Howard: Ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs.
Bernadette: Yeah, try doing it in heels.
Howard: I am.
Bernadette: Wait. Theres something I have to tell you.
Howard: What?
Bernadette: I know what was in your dads letter.
Howard: Sheldon, I swear to God, Im gonna kill you.
Amy: Hey.
Bernadette: I made him tell us.
Howard: What? Us? Who else knows?
Penny: I know.
Amy: Me, too.
Leonard: Same here.
Raj: Shame on all of you.
Leonard: You know, too.
Raj: Couldnt leave him one friend, could you?
Howard: So everybody knows whats in that letter except for me?
Sheldon: Yes, its six against one. Stand down, sir.
Howard: How could you do this?
Bernadette: Im sorry.
Raj: If you want, we could tell you.
Howard: No, I dont want to know. I mean, I do, but I got to go.
Amy: Use me as a human shield!
Sheldon: I panicked. He looked taller than usual.
Scene: The closet.
Bernadette (off): Howard?
Howard: In here.
Bernadette: Im sorry. I should have left it alone.
Howard: Its okay. Sorry I ran off like that.
Bernadette: What are you looking at?
Howard: Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid.
Bernadette: Thats nice.
Howard: I got to tell you, as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet. Look at this. Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever. Check out nine-year-old Howie with cornrows. Neither race was happy to see me with those.
Bernadette: Think you could take a break?
Howard: Why?
Bernadette: Got a little surprise for you. Come on.
Howard: Oh, honey, I am in no mood to have sex tonight. Ill lay there if you absolutely have to have it, but Oh. What are you guys doing here?
Leonard: When you left, you werent sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dads letter, so we came up with kind of a cool solution.
Howard: Oh, yeah, whats that?
Sheldon: Its simple, really. It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition. The, the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once.
Penny: We were all thinking it, really. It was kind of the elephant in the room, so
Sheldon: Anyway, um, I realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you, only one of which is true, and then we dont tell you which one it is, you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence.
Penny: Yeah. And I said if it wasnt epistemic, we might as well not do it.
Bernadette: Sit down, honey.
Leonard: Raj, youre up.
Raj: Okay, um, It was a card for your 18th birthday. Inside it said, Happy birthday, Howard. I love you. Dad. Oh, and it was a Far Side card, the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane. Thinks its a fly. Silly frog. So funny.
Leonard: Sheldon.
Sheldon: It was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.
Howard: Nice try. Thats the plot for Goonies.
Amy: Told you.
Sheldon: Dont.
Leonard: Amy.
Amy: You didnt know it, but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation. And he cried because he was so proud of you.
Howard: Really?
Sheldon: Or thats complete poppycock which Amy made up. It still could be the map.
Leonard: Penny.
Penny: It was a letter explaining that your dad wasnt who he said he was. Eventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave.
Sheldon: I would like to change mine. The pirates name was Peg-Leg Antoine. Now its completely different from Goonies.
Amy: No, its not.
Sheldon: Dont.
Leonard: Okay, my turn. Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing, and that you should never throw it away like he did.
Howard: Hmm.
Leonard: Bernadette.
Bernadette: Inside the envelope was a picture of your dad holding you the day you were born. On the back he wrote Howard, my son, my greatest gift. You okay?
Howard: Yeah. Im terrific.
Leonard: So, which one do you think it is, matey?
Howard: Actually, I dont want to know. I want all of them to be true.
Leonard: Well, one of them is.
Howard: Thats pretty cool. Thank you, guys.
Penny: Hey, its still early. Why dont we go back and have that party?
Raj: Yeah,
Leonard: Yeah, cool.
Amy: Okay.
Sheldon: You know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your father wasnt the most interesting thing I read in the closet. Bernadettes diary has some saucy passages.
Bernadette: Sheldon, dont you dare.
Sheldon: Theres nothing to worry about. Your secrets safe with me.
Bernadette: Thats more like it.
Sheldon: Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.
Scene: The apartment.
Bernadette: Glad youre feeling better.
Howard: Me, too. If Id known we were gonna be dancing, would have worn my flats.
Penny: This turned out pretty well, huh?
Leonard: Yeah, I think so.
Raj: I agree. That is, if youve never been to or heard of a party before.
Amy: If youd let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, youd be happy all the time.
Sheldon: Uh, Penny, I, I have a couple of questions about your closet. Is there any reason youre keeping this dead goldfish?
Penny: Damn, I forgot to feed him. And that I had him.
Sheldon: Well, now, did you also have a dog? Because I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy.
Penny: Partys over! Partys over!
