Scene: The apartment kitchen. Penny is cooking breakfast while singing and dancing along to Man I Feel Like A Woman by Shenia Twain. Sheldon enters.
Penny: Morning, Sheldon. Come dance with me.
Sheldon: No.
Penny: Why not?
Sheldon: Penny, while I subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that in none of them am I dancing.
Penny: Are you fun in any of them?
Sheldon: The math would suggest that in a few Im a clown made of candy. But I dont dance.
Penny: All right, want some French toast?
Sheldon: Its Oatmeal Day.
Penny: Tell you what, next French Toast Day, I will make you oatmeal.
Sheldon: Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French Toast Day?
Leonard: Morning.
Sheldon: Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast.
Leonard: Sorry. I havent given her your schedule yet.
Sheldon: Its an iCal download, she can put it right in her phone. And I thought we agreed that youd have your conjugal visits in her apartment.
Leonard: We did, but there were extenuating circumstances.
Sheldon: I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?
Leonard: No, her bed kind of broke.
Sheldon: That doesnt seem likely. Her beds of sturdy construction. Even the addition
of a second normal size human being wouldnt cause a structural failure, much less a homunculus such as yourself.
Penny: A homunculus?
Leonard: Perfectly formed miniature human being.
Penny: Oh, youre my little homunculus.
Leonard: Dont do that.
Penny: Sorry. Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?
Sheldon: I want oatmeal.
Penny: Yes, well, I want a boyfriend whose roommate isnt a giant pain in the ass.
Sheldon: Im sure that will happen soon enough. But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal.
Penny: You know what, I give up. Hes impossible.
Sheldon: I cant be impossible. I exist. I believe what you meant to say is, I give up, hes improbable.
Leonard: Sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with Penny.
Sheldon: What am I supposed to do, eat French toast on a Monday? Now, that would be impossible.
Leonard: Im just saying, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
Sheldon: You can catch even more flies with manure. Whats your point?
Leonard: Its a (gives up)
Sheldon: Boy, that does smell good. Too bad its Monday.
Credits sequence.
Scene: The apartment.
 
Penny: Okay, so Kim the night manager went on maternity leave, and her husbands name is Sandy, right? So get this, her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husbands name is Kim.
Leonard: Wow!
Penny: I know. What are the odds?
Sheldon: Easily calculable, we begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names. We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work, the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example. Next we look at
Leonard: Sheldon! its an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?
Sheldon: Im sorry. Ooh, Penny, its as if the Cheesecake Factory is run by witches.
Penny: Ooh, Sheldon, its as if you dont think Ill punch you.
Leonard: Come on, you guys, let it go.
Penny: Fine, whatever. Are you finished?
Sheldon: Well, thank you. How thoughtful. Would you like a chocolate
Penny: Um, yeah, sure, thanks.
Leonard: What was that?
Sheldon: You said be nice to Penny. I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.
Leonard: It does. But in my experience, you dont.
Sheldon: There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
Leonard: Yeah, yeah, now thats you, obnoxious and insufferable.
Howard (arriving, in goth gear): Whats going on, day dwellers?
Penny: Oh, man, did the Kiss Army repeal dont ask, dont tell?
Howard: No. Raj and I are going a goth club in Hollywood to hang with the night people. Anybody want to come along?
Penny: Oh, wow, youre actually going out like that?
Howard: No, no. Im going out like this. (Whips off jacket to reveal tattoos up both arms)
Leonard: Howard, what did you do?
Howard: Theyre called tattoo sleeves. Look. I bought them online, Raj got a set, too. Fantastic, right? Put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery.
Sheldon: You know, Ive always wanted to go to a goth nighclub.
Howard: Really?
Sheldon: Bazinga! None of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?
Howard: Okay, how about you two? Look, Ive got some extra tat sleeves.
Leonard: Why are you carrying extras?
Howard: Well, In case I snag one on someones nipple ring.
Penny: Uh, yeah, I think well pass.
Howard: Oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now?
Leonard: In this case, you bet she is.
Howard (after Raj whispers): Yes, shes pushy and yes, hes whipped, but thats not the expression. Come on, I want to stop at Walgreens and pick up some more eyeliner.
Leonard: Theyre gonna get beaten up at that club.
Penny: Theyre gonna get beaten up at Walgreens. Oh, sorry, Sheldon, I almost sat in your spot.
Sheldon: Did you? I didnt notice. Have a chocolate.
Penny: Thank you.
Scene: The goth club.
 
Raj: I think were fitting in quite nicely.
Howard: Itd help if you werent drinking light beer.
Raj: Oh, whats so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?
Howard: Hello, it looks like blood. Did you even read the Wiki How link I sent you on being goth?
Raj: No, Im behind on my wiki-reading Im kind of on a John Grisham kick right now.
Howard: What?
Raj: Well, I finished reading The Pelican Brief and loved it so much, I dived right into The Client. He was a lawyer himself so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining.
Howard: Just remember we are lost boys, children of the night.
Raj: Great. Lost boys, children of the night. Got it. Can you pass the Chex mix, please. Thank you. We are lost boys.
Girl: Good for you.
Howard: Im actually much morelost than he is.
Girl: Nice ink.
Howard: Thanks. Can we buy you ladies a drink?
Girl: Two light beers.
Raj: Light beers? Well, Wiki-how about that?
Second girl: Whats your names?
Howard: Im Howard.
Raj: Raj.
Girl: Im Bethany.
Howard: Nice to meet you, Bethany.
Raj: Yes, very nice.
Bethany: Nice to meet you too.
Second girl: Im Sarah. Not that anyone cares.
Raj: Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of John Grisham?
Scene: The apartment. 
Penny: Whats this cartoon called again?
Leonard: Oshikuru: Demon Samurai.
Sheldon: And its not a cartoon, its anime.
Penny: Anime. You know, I knew a girl in high school named Anna May. Anna May Fletcher. She was born with one nostril. Then she had this bad nose job and basically wound up with three.
Sheldon: Youre here a lot now.
Penny: Oh, am I talking too much? Im sorry. Zip.
Sheldon: Thank you. Chocolate?
Penny: Yes please. (Her phone rings) Oh. Hey, Kim. Yeah, I (sees Sheldon looking disapprovingly) You know what, hold on, let me take this in the hall. (Sheldon silently offers her another chocolate. She takes it.) Youll never guess who they got to replace you at work
Leonard: Okay, I know what youre doing.
Sheldon: Really?
Leonard: Yes, youre using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour.
Sheldon: Very good. Chocolate?
Leonard: No, I dont want any chocolate! Sheldon, you cant train my girlfriend like a lab rat.
Sheldon: Actually, it turns out I can.
Leonard: Well, you shouldnt.
Sheldon: Theres just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard? You werent happy with my previous approach to dealing with her, so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques, building on the work of Thorndike and B.F. Skinner. By this time next week, I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool, balancing a beach ball on her nose.
Leonard: No, this has to stop now.
Sheldon: Im not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool. I thought the bazinga was implied. Im just tweaking her personality, sanding off the rough edges if you will.
Leonard: No, youre not sanding Penny.
Sheldon: Are you saying that Im forbidden from applying a harmless, scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?
Leonard: Yes, youre forbidden.
Sheldon (Squirting him with a water spray): Bad Leonard.
Scene: The goth club.
 
Bethany: So what do you guys do?
Howard: Oh, you know, goth stuff. Goth magazines, goth music.
Raj: Goth food.
Sarah: Whats goth food?
Raj: Uh blackened salmon?
Bethany: No, I meant what do you do for jobs?
Raj: Oh, were scientists.
Howard: Yeah, you know, the dark sciences.
Bethany: What are the dark sciences
Raj: Well, I am an astrophysicist and a lot of that takes place at night. When there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about.
Howard: Oy vay.
Raj: That sounds really cool.
Howard: Does it? Okay, if you like space stuff, I design components for the international space station. Which is in space. Where, as Im sure you know, no one can hear you scream.
Raj: So what do you gals do?
Bethany: I work at the Gap.
Howard: Really? How about that? Ive been to the Gap.
Raj: Yeah, Ive been there as well. I like your tee-shirts with the little pocket.
Sarah: I work there too. Not that anyone cares. You know, this place is boring.
Bethany: Yeah. Why dont we go somewhere else and have some fun?
Howard: Okay.
Raj: Sure, we like fun.
Howard: We are fun people.
Raj: Dark and fun.
Bethany: Come on, I know a place youll really dig.
Howard: Did you bring the black condoms?
Raj: In my fanny pack.
Howard: Lets go.
Scene: A tattoo parlour. Bethany is getting a tattoo.
 
Raj: Are you happy now?
Howard: Not particularly.
Scene: The apartment.
 
Penny (voice outside door): Oh my God, she didnt!
Leonard: What could she possibly be talking about for so long?
Sheldon: Obviously, waitressing at the Cheesecake Factory is a complex socioeconomic activity, that requires a great deal of analysis and planning. Bazinga! You know, using positive reinforcement techniques, I could train that behaviour out of her in a week.
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: If you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed.
Leonard: Youre not squirting her in the face with water.
Sheldon: No, of course not. Were talking very mild electric shocks. No tissue damage whatsoever.
Leonard: Forget it.
Sheldon: Oh, come on, you cant tell me that youre not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend.
Leonard: Im not. And Pennys qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is.
Sheldon: You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon You wouldnt prefer a throaty chuckle?
Leonard: Youre not changing how Penny laughs.
Sheldon: No, that would be incongruous, I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register.
Penny (entering): Uh, sorry guys, that girl is (high pitched) freaky!
Sheldon: Come again?
Penny (normal voice): Freaky.
Sheldon (lower voice): Freaky?
Penny (lower voice): Yeah, freaky.
Sheldon: Have a chocolate.
Penny: Thank you.
Scene: The tattoo parlour. Howard is laying down, preparing to have a tattoo on his lower back.
Raj: Are you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex with a strange girl you met in a bar?
Howard: Uh, yeah!
Raj: What is your mother going to say?
Howard: Shes not going to see it. She takes my temperature orally now.
Bethany: What are you going to get, Howard?
Howard: Well, I cant really decide between a screaming devil, this mean little skull or Kermit the Frog.
Bethany: Kermit the Frog?
Howard: You know (Kermit voice) Hi ho, Im on Howards butt!
Bethany: Get the mean little skull, and Ill see if I can make him smile.
Howard: Yeah, Id like the mean little skull, please.
Sarah: What are you going to get, Raj?
Raj: With my luck, hepatitis
Tattooist: Okay, here we go.
Howard: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Tattooist: Thats just rubbing alcohol.
Howard: I know, but it was cold. Ow, ow, ow!
Tattooist: Im putting on the stencil.
Howard: What comes after the stencil?
Tattooist: This.
Howard: Aaaaaargh! Okay, thats it, no needle, no pain, no tattoo.
Bethany: Whats the big deal, youve done this before.
Howard: No, I havent, look. (Rips off tattoo sleeves) Im sorry, Im a fraud, hes a fraud.
Raj: Were both frauds.
Howard: Yeah, I think I covered that.
Raj: But I was summing up.
Howard: Were not goth, were just guys.
Raj: Very, very smart guys.
Bethany: So you were totally scamming us?
Howard: Yes. And I wouldnt blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again. Unless of course our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive.
Bethany: Im leaving.
Sarah: Im leaving too. Not that anyone cares.
Raj: When we tell this story, lets end it differently.
Howard: What are you thinking? Maybe a big musical number?
Scene: The apartment.
Sheldon: Well, Im going to make some warm milk and then turn in. I trust if you two are planning in engaging in amorous activites, youll keep the decibel level to a minimum.
Penny: Of course.
Sheldon: Thank you. (Throws a chocolate. Penny catches it in her mouth)
 
Penny: Mmm, these are so good
Leonard: Unbelievable.
Penny: What?
Leonard: I was just thinking, we should probably turn in too.
Penny: well, my new bed got delivered, if you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place.
Leonard: Really, thats a lot of work, and its kind of late.
Penny: Yeah, but if we stay there, we wont have to be quiet.
Leonard: Lets go.
Sheldon: Interesting. Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour. I wonder if anyone else has stumbled on to that.
Scene: Rajs car.
 
Howard: Okay, wait, how about this? We say there were four goth girls, the two girls in the club had two friends.
Raj: I like it, I like it. Did they smell good despite their gothlike nature?
Howard: Whats that got to do with the story?
Raj: Engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.
Howard: Fine, they smelled good.
Raj: Oh, they did. Like jasmine and honeysuckle.
Howard: Whatever.
Raj: And then they held hands and did a sexy, demonic hokey-pokey for us.
Howard: No, no. Look, let me say my story all the way through, and then you can say yours, and then well pick.
Raj: Im sorry. Go on.
Howard: Okay. We got tattoos, and then the four girls took us to their place.
Raj: But we dont have tattoos. What if someone asks to see our tattoos?
Howard: We say theyre in a very intimate area.
Raj: Oh, we are bad boys, arent we?
Howard: Right, right, so we go back to their place, and then the six of us end up in a hot tub.
Raj: But we just got tattoos. Wouldnt we be concerned about bacterial infection?
Howard: True. Okay, forget the hot tub. The point is, we each have a mnage with sexy goth girls.
Raj: Wow. What a great night.
Howard: Yeah. Hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night.
Raj: Yeah, maybe well get lucky with some sexy cowgirls.
Howard: Could happen.
Raj: I wonder how they smell.
