Scene: The university cafeteria.
Sheldon: Your argument is lacking in all scientific merit. It is well established Superman cleans his uniform by flying into Earths yellow sun, which incinerates any contaminate matter and leaves the invulnerable Kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.
Howard: What if he gets something Kryptonian on it?
Sheldon: Like what?
Howard: I dont know. Kryptonian mustard.
Sheldon: I think we can safely assume that all Kryptonian condiments were destroyed when the planet Krypton exploded.
Raj: Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite, the only way to destroy a rogue Kryptonian hotdog threatening Earth.
Leonard: Raj, please, lets stay serious here. Supermans body is Kryptonian, therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.
Howard: Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?
Sheldon: Superman doesnt sweat on Earth.
Howard: Okay, hes invited for dinner in the Bottle City of Kandor. He miniaturizes himself, enters the city where he loses his superpowers. Now, before dinner, his host says, whos up for a little Kryptonian tetherball? Superman says sure, works up a sweat, comes back to Earth, his uniform now stained with indestructible Kryptonian perspiration.
Raj: Booya.
Sheldon: Superman would have taken his uniform to a Kandorian dry cleaner before he left the Bottle.
Raj: Kandorian dry cl I give up, you cant have a rational argument with this man.
Howard: Hey, isnt that the guy who won the MacArthur genius grant last year? No, not all at once.
Raj: Then how?
Howard: Leonard. Now, Raj. Now, Sheldon.
Raj: I didnt get a good look. Can I go again?
Howard: No.
Leonard: Its David Underhill. So what?
Sheldon: So what? His observation of high-energy positrons has provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter.
Leonard: I have two words for you. The first is big, the others whoop.
Sheldon: It is a big whoop. It made almost all the work youve done since youve been here completely useless.
Leonard: Did not.
Howard: Did, too.
Leonard: Did okay, maybe some of it, but, look, the guy was just in the right place, at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting reinterpretation of the universe. He got lucky.
Raj: In more ways than one. Hes a very handsome man.
Howard: Doesnt do anything for me. If I was gonna go that way, Im more of a Zac Ephron kinda guy.
Raj: Oh, yeah, like you have a shot with Zac Ephron.
David (approaching): Excuse me, Are you Leonard Hofstadter?
Leonard: Uh, yeah.
David: Im David Underhill.
Leonard: Uh, y-yeah.
David: Yeah, Dr. Gablehauser said if I wanted to set something up in the photomultiplier lab, that youd be able to give me a hand?
Leonard: You want to work with me?
David: Well, if you have a little time, yeah.
Leonard: Wow, y-yeah, sure. Yeah, no problem. Uh, Heres my home number, heres my cell, heres my office, heres my parents number up in New Jersey, they always know how to reach me. So
David: Okay.
Leonard: Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant, by the way. Big fan.
David: Thanks. Ill call you.
Leonard: Okay. Bye-bye! What are you looking at?Youve never seen a hypocrite before?
Credits sequence.
 
Scene: The apartment. The guys are playing Wii bowling.
Raj: Trailing badly, Wolowitz needs a strike if he has any hopes of catching up with Sheldon Cooper, who is dominating in the ninth frame with a career-best 68.
Leonard (entering): Hey, guys!
Howard: That doesnt count. Do over! Do over!
Sheldon: There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.
Howard: There are always do-overs when my people play sports.
Sheldon: Where were you thats more important than Wii bowling night?
Leonard: Actually, I was
Sheldon: Its a rhetorical question. There is nothing more important than Wii bowling night.
Leonard: Come on, its just a video game. And we suck at it.
Sheldon: Nice motivational speech from the team captain.
Howard: Where were you?
Leonard: I was working with Dave Underhill.
Howard: Ooh, Dave. Sounds like Leonards got a new BFF.
Leonard: Actually, hes pretty cool. I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist, but it turns out hes a Black Diamond skier, he collects vintage motorcycles, he plays in a rock band.
Howard: So? Were in a rock band.
Leonard: No, we play Rock Band on our X-Box.
Sheldon: Nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist.
Leonard: Hes funny, too. He does this hysterical impersonation of Stephen Hawking having phone sex. What are you wearing? Thats not, he does it better. Anyway, he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow, so Im gonna go practice my situps.
Raj: Whoa. Humongous man crush, dude.
Howard: Yep. Its officially a bro-mance.
Penny (entering): Hey, Sheldon, are you and Leonard putting up a Christmas tree?
Sheldon: No, because we dont celebrate the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia.
Penny: Saturnalia?
Howard: Gather round, kids, its time for Sheldons beloved Christmas special.
Sheldon: In the pre-Christian era, as the winter solstice approached and the plants died, pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes as an act of sympathetic magic, intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring. This custom was later appropriated by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes the so-called Christmas tree.
Howard: And that, Charlie Brown, is what boredom is all about.
Penny: Okay, well, thank you for that, but I got you and Leonard a few silly neighbour gifts, so Ill just put them under my tree.
Sheldon: Wait! You bought me a present?
Penny: Uh-huh.
Sheldon: Why would you do such a thing?
Penny: I dont know. Cause its Christmas?
Sheldon: Oh, Penny. I know you think youre being generous, but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity. You havent given me a gift, youve given me an obligation.
Howard: Dont feel bad, Penny, its a classic rookie mistake. My first Hanukkah with Sheldon, he yelled at me for eight nights.
Penny: Now, honey, its okay.You dont have to get me anything in return.
Sheldon: Of course I do. The essence of the custom is that I now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift youve given me. Its no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.
Penny: Okay, you know what? Forget it. Im not giving you a present.
Sheldon: No, its too late. I see it. That elf sticker says to Sheldon. The die has been cast, the moving finger has writ, Hannibal has crossed the Alps.
Howard (to Raj who is whispering in his ear): I know. Its funny when its not happening to us.
Penny: Sheldon, I am very, very sorry.
Sheldon: No. No, I brought this on myself by being such an endearing and important part of your life. Im going to need a ride to the mall.
Howard: Its happening to us.
Scene: The stairwell.
Leonard: Ow! Ow!
David: Are you gonna make it?
Leonard: Yeah, I guess.
David: All right.
Leonard: Thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle.
David: No problem.
Leonard: I had no idea it was so heavy. The thing just fell right over on me, didnt it?
David: Yeah. Lucky for you it wasnt moving.
Penny: Oh, hey, Leonard. Ooh, are you okay?
Leonard: Oh, yeah. Its just a little motorcycle accident.
Penny: My God, how fast were you going?
Leonard: I dont know. Its all such a blur.
David: Ha ha ha. Good one. He couldnt even get it started. Hi. Dave.
Penny: Hi. Penny. So its your motorcycle?
David: Uh-huh.
Penny: Oh, is it okay?
David: Its fine.
Leonard: Yeah, lucky for the bike it landed on my leg.
David: You mind giving me a hand with speed racer here?
Penny: Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. So, um, Dave, how do you know Leonard?
David: Im a physicist.
Penny: Ha-ha. No, youre not.
David: Why is that so surprising?
Penny: Uh, well, its just that the physicists I know are indoorsy and pale.
Leonard: Im not indoorsy. I just wear the appropriate sun block because I dont take melanoma lightly.
Penny: So, are you and Leonard working on an experiment together?
David: Yeah, actually we are.
Leonard: Yeah, were examining the radiation levels of photomultiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector.
Penny: Uh, sweetie, sweetie, Dave was talking. You know, I love science.
Leonard: Since when?
Penny: Since always. Call me a geek, but I am just nuts for the whole subatomic particle thing.
David: The last thing I would ever call you is a geek.
Penny: Ha. Well, thats what I am, queen of the nerds.
David: Well, if you like, I could show you the lab were working in. Weve got some cool toys, you know, lasers and stuff.
Penny: You know, I have always wanted to see a big science lab.
Leonard: Since when?
Penny: Since always.
David: Leonard, are you okay here?
Leonard: Uh, yeah. I guess.
David: How bout we go see it now? Maybe afterwards we take the bike up the coast, we grab a little bite to eat
Penny: Um,yeah, yeah, that sounds great, let me just get my jacket.
David: Boy, shell do, huh?
Leonard: Yeah, if you like that type.
David: So, you and her?
Leonard: No, just neighbours.
David: Really. I dont know how you live next door to that without doing something about it.
Leonard: Actually, science is my lady.
Penny: Okay. Lets go.
David: All right. See you tomorrow, Leonard.
Leonard: See ya. Bye, Penny. Have fun. (Bangs head on door. Sheldon opens it.)
Sheldon: Yes? (Leonard falls through) Did you forget your key?
Scene: A gift shop.
 
Sheldon: I dont see anything in here a woman would want.
Howard: Youre kidding. Youve got lotions and bath oils and soaps, thats the estrogen hat trick.
Leonard: What it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla. Its as if my head were trapped in the pyjamas of a sultan.
Raj: Sheldon, if you dont like this stuff, lets just go next door and build her a bear.
Sheldon: I told you before, bears are terrifying.
Howard: Come on, bath stuff, its perfect! You got a scented candle, a cleansing buff, spearmint and green tea scented bath oil, promotes relaxation.
Sheldon: That presupposes Penny is tense.
Raj: She knows you. Shes tense. We all are. Buy a basket!
Howard: Excuse me, were ready.
Sheldon: No, were not. Lets say for a moment that I accept the bath item gift hypothesis, I now lay the following conundrum at your feet, which size?
Howard: This one. Lets go.
Sheldon: You put no thought into that.
Howard: Im sorry. Uh, this one. Lets go!
Sheldon: I have insufficient data to proceed. Excuse me, miss?
Assistant: Yes?
Sheldon: If I were to give you this gift basket, based on that action alone and no other data, infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us.
Assistant: Excuse me?
Sheldon: Here. Now, are we friends? Colleagues? Lovers? Are you my grandmother?
Assistant: I dont understand what youre talking about and youre making me a little uncomfortable.
Howard: See? Sounds just like you and Penny. Well take it.
Scene: The university cafeteria.
David: Hey, Leonard. Come, join us.
Leonard: Oh, hey, Dave. And Penny, what a surprise.
Penny: Hey, Leonard. Dave was just showing me around the university. You know, this place is unbelievable!
Leonard: Yeah, I know. Ive been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga.
Penny: I never said that.
Leonard: Maybe I heard you wrong. A lot of words sound like yoga.
David: This is an amazing woman, Leonard. She has a curious and agile mind, not to mention being curious and agile in other respects.
Penny: Oh, shut up!
Leonard: Yes, please shut up. So, um, Dave, dont you think you and I should get back to the lab? You know, that dark matter isnt going to detect itself.
David: Actually, I was thinking about taking the afternoon off so I could work on another experiment with Penny.
Penny: Really? Were going to do an experiment?
David: Uh-huh. Were going to explore the effects of tequila shots on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman.
Penny: Its not an experiment! You saw what happened last night.
David: You ready to go?
Penny: Yeah. Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?
David: Yeah, why not? You cant do any worse than Leonard.
Leonard: Thats funny. By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
Scene: The apartment.
 
Sheldon: Mmm, great news, Leonard, Ive solved my Penny gift dilemma.
Leonard: Yippee.
Sheldon: You see, the danger was that I might under or over-reciprocate, but I have devised a foolproof plan. See, I will open her gift to me first and then excuse myself, feigning digestive distress.
Then Ill look up the price of her gift online, choose the basket closest to that value, give it to her and then Ill return the others for a full refund.
Leonard: Brilliant.
Sheldon: It is, isnt it? Is it okay if I hide them in your room? The smell makes me nauseated.
Leonard: Do whatever you want.
Sheldon: Thank you, thats very gracious.  Gentlemen.
Howard: Why couldnt you have just done what Leonard did and get Penny a new boyfriend?
Leonard: My leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
 
Scene: Pennys apartment.
 
Leonard: Okay, I have just one question for you. While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us, you said that you didnt want to go out with me because I was too smart for you! Well, news flash, lady, David Underhill is ten times smarter than me! Youd have to drive a railroad spike into his brain for me to beat him at checkers! Next to him, Im like one of those sign-language gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes! So, my question is, whats up with that?
Penny: Why are you yelling at me?
Leonard: Sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry! Never mind, were cool.
Penny: Dave is not smarter than you. Hes an idiot.
Leonard: Really? Why would you say that?
Penny: Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend.
Leonard: He tried to take nude photos of you?
Penny: Thats what you took from that? The guy is married!
Leonard: Oh, yeah. Im so oh, thats terrible.
Penny: And you, if you are so okay with the way things are between us, why are you so jealous?
Leonard: Well, uh, the important thing is hes married and thats terrible!
Penny: Nice save, genius. Eggnog?
Leonard: Lactose.
Penny: Its just rum. It stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago.
Leonard: Smooth.
Penny: Smoother than you.
Leonard: Come on, its Christmas, just give me this one.
Penny: Okay, Merry Christmas.
Leonard: By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
Scene: The apartment. Leonard opens the door to Penny.
Penny: Merry Christmas.
Leonard: Merry Christmas.
Penny: Hows your leg?
Leonard: Very good, thanks for asking. Come on in.
Sheldon: Ah, good, Penny, youre here to exchange gifts. Youll be pleased to know Im prepared for whatever you have to offer.
Penny: Okay, here.
Sheldon: I should note Im having some digestive distress, so, if I excuse myself abruptly, dont be alarmed. Oh, a napkin.
Penny: Turn it over.
Sheldon: To Sheldon, live long and prosper. Leonard Nimoy.
Penny: Yeah, he came into the restaurant. Sorry the napkins dirty. He wiped his mouth with it.
Sheldon: I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!
Penny: Well, yeah, yeah, I guess. But look, he signed it.
Sheldon: Do you realize what this means? All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!
Penny: Okay, all Im giving you is the napkin, Sheldon.
Sheldon: Be right back.
Penny: Here. Open it.
Leonard: Oh, a gift certificate for motorcycle lessons. Very thoughtful.
Penny: Yeah, and I checked. Not letting the bike fall on you while standing still is lesson one.
Leonard: Oh, then, I think youll appreciate what I got you.
Penny: Okay. 101 Totally Cool Science Experiments for Kids.
Leonard: You know, cause youre so into science.
(Sheldon appears with all the gift baskets)
Penny: Sheldon! What did you do?!
Sheldon: I know! Its not enough, is it? Here.
Penny: Leonard, look! Sheldons hugging me.
Leonard: Its a Saturnalia miracle.
