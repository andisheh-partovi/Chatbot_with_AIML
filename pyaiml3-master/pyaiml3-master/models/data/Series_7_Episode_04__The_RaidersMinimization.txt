Scene: The apartment.
Sheldon: So whatd you think?
Amy: It was good.
Sheldon: Thats it? Good
Amy: I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be losing my virginity, I didnt think you meant showing me Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time.
Sheldon: My apologies. I chose my words poorly. I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch. Anyway, thank you for watching it. Its one of my all-time favourites.
Amy: It was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem.
Sheldon: Story problem? You, oh, Amy, what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation. Ive watched it 36 times, except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene, which I can only watch when its still light out, but, I defy you to find a story problem. Heres my jaw, drop it.
Amy: All right. Indiana Jones plays no role in the outcome of the story. If he werent in the film, it would turn out exactly the same.
Sheldon: Oh, I see your confusion. You dont understand. Indiana Jones was the one in the hat with the whip.
Amy: No, I do, and if he werent in the movie, the Nazis would have still found the ark, taken it to the island, opened it up and all died, just like they did. Let me close that for ya.
Credits sequence.
Scene: The foyer.
Leonard: Hey.
Penny: Hi. I thought you went to the comic book store on Wednesdays.
Leonard: Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy were having date night and they dont need me there to make it awkward. They have each other for that. So, how was school?
Penny: Oh, good. Check it out, The Disappointing Child by Beverly Hofstadter.
Leonard: You bought my moms book?
Penny: Yeah. Its on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.
Leonard: Oh, come on. Not that book. It, its got, like, every horrible story from my childhood in it.
Penny: Oh, cool. Are there pictures?
Leonard: Seriously, please find another book.
Penny: Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?
Leonard: There, theres chapters about potty training, and bed-wetting and masturbation. Basically, if something came out of me, she wrote about it. You know what? Do whatever you want, just dont talk to me about it.
Penny: Not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?
Leonard: It was not a crisis. Apparently, I favoured the left one, she got a little lopsided.
Penny: Oh, my God, you still go left.
Scene: The cafeteria.
Raj: Which celebrity would you say I look like the most?
Howard: Halle Berry. Why?
Raj: Stuart and I are putting dating profiles online, and its one of the questions. And thank you, Id kill for that womans bone structure.
Leonard: Why are you reading Pride and Prejudice?
Sheldon: Ill tell you why. Amy ruined Raiders of the Lost Ark for me, so now Im trying to find something beloved to her and ruin that.
Howard: Because her life wasnt enough?
Raj: Wait, how can, how can anyone ruin Raiders? Its perfect.
Sheldon: Yeah, except for the fact that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story. With or without him, the Nazis find the ark, open it and die.
All: Aw!
Howard: Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis were digging in the wrong place. The only reason they got the ark was because Indy found it first.
Leonard: Actually, they were only digging in the wrong place because Indy had the medallion. Without him, they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place.
All: Aw!
Scene: Pennys apartment.
Penny: Okay, I know you dont want to talk about it, but can I just ask you one question about your moms book?
Leonard: No.
Penny: I just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts on his moms make-up and wears balloon boobies.
Leonard: They werent boobies, they were muscles. And the make-up was green. I was pretending to be The Hulk.
Penny: You were wearing her bra.
Leonard: That was to keep my muscles from sagging. Can we please stop talking about this?
Penny: Okay, okay. But you know, as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, I think, sometimes, its good to open up about these things.
Leonard: Okay, fine. Do you want to know why I dressed like The Hulk? Because I was always mad at my mom and I wanted to smash my way out of that house.
Penny: Well, why were you so angry?
Leonard: Gee, I dont know. Maybe its because I was always the subject of her little experiments. Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long Id keep looking? The answer, by the way, June.
Penny: Sweetie, Im so sorry. I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better.
Leonard: I do, too, but theres not.
Penny: Really? Are you sure about that?
Leonard: Of course, who am I to argue with a check-plus student? Just warning you, Im gonna go right. Dont make a big deal out of it.
Scene: Rajs apartment.
Stuart: Is make-up really necessary?
Raj: Well, when someone looks at your dating profile, the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right, here we go, and smile. Okay, uh-uh, that ones in the bank. How about this? Turn away, and then turn back into it. But when you do, imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet.
Stuart: You got it.
Raj: Okay, uh, lets try it again. Uh, but this time, pretend the girl you want to meet doesnt want to hurt you.
Stuart: I dont think I can give you that.
Raj: Come on. One more time. Yeah, its, its a little blurry, but I think that works in your favour. Do you want a beer?
Stuart: Sure. Hey, have you finished writing your profile yet?
Raj: Almost. Oh, what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?
Stuart: I put unobjectionable. But now that I hear it out loud, it just seems like Im being cocky. What did you put for your best feature?
Raj: My parents money. Uh, what did you put for your best feature?
Stuart: I put: not applicable.
Raj: Come on, dude, youre being too hard on yourself. Youve got a lot of good stuff going on.
Stuart: Really? Like what?
Raj: Well, okay, youre a, youre a talented artist, you own your own business.
Stuart: Neither of those things have ever helped me meet a woman.
Raj: Okay, well, can we imply that youre well-endowed?
Stuart: I do have one oddly long testicle.
Raj: Okay, now youre talking like a winner!
Scene: The apartment.
Leonard: Whatcha doin?
Sheldon: Oh, it turns out Amys beloved Pride and Prejudice is a flawless masterpiece. Hes got too much pride, shes got too much prejudice, it just works.
Leonard: So youre looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages?
Sheldon: Amy has a fondness for the comic strip Marmaduke.
Leonard: Mm-hmm. And?
Sheldon: And I think Ive got it. Consider, a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined, he causes nothing but problems. Why do they keep him?
Leonard: Maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didnt know how big he was gonna be.
Sheldon: Of course. You know, why couldnt she just like Ziggy? Yeah? That things riddled with plot holes.
Leonard: Sorry, buddy.
Sheldon: Ooh, I think shes a fan of Garfield as well. Oh, darn it, now so am I.
Leonard: Ill see you later. I gotta go watch a stupid football game with Penny.
Sheldon: Wait, hang on. Youve spent time with Amy. Can you think of anything shes fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasnt noticed?
Leonard: I gotta go.
Scene: Pennys apartment. 
Leonard: You ready to go?
Penny: Yep. Hey, and maybe this time you dont try and talk sports with the guys.
Leonard: Some sports bar. Its like they never even heard of Quidditch. Do we really have to go?
Penny: Oh, come on. Every time were about to hang out with my friends, you dont want to. Its like, Its too loud, or the bathrooms too dirty, or they put a chicken wing in my ear. I mean
Leonard: Well, youre, youre right. Lets just go.
Penny: Hey, whats going on with you?
Leonard: Nothing, Im fine.
Penny: All right, hang on. is this still about your moms book?
Leonard: No. Not everything is about my mom. 
Penny: Cause if youre still upset about that, we dont have to go.
Leonard: Except this is totally about my mom.
Penny: Im so sorry. I never should have read that book. You know what? You want to just get dinner and watch the game here?
Leonard: That sounds nice. Yeah.
Penny: Okay.
Leonard: Or, you know, we could get take-out and watch the Blu-ray extended version of The Hobbit movie with commentary track. On account of how sad I am about my mom.
Scene: Leonards lab.
Howard: Leonard, you ready for lunch?
Leonard: One sec. Hey. Sorry.
Howard: Hi, Penny.
Penny: Hi. All right, sweetie. You hang in there today.
Leonard: Ill try, but I might be sad again tonight.
Penny: Okay.
Howard: Wow. Sex at work?
Leonard: Leave it alone. Thats my girlfriend.
Howard: Sorry. 
Leonard: Who just had sex with me at work.
Howard: Damn. Howd you swing that?
Leonard: Well, whenever I talk about how awful my mom was, Penny will do anything to make me feel better.
Howard: Seriously?
Leonard: Look, I mean, Im not proud of it, but it does work. I got her to watch a six-part documentary on Monty Python. Even I was bored, I just wanted to see if shed make it to the end.
Howard: You sound kind of proud of it.
Leonard: I am, Im really proud.
Scene: The apartment.
Amy (on webcam): Hello, Sheldon. Is everything okay?
Sheldon: Yes. Why?
Amy: Well, the last time you made an unscheduled video-chat, there was a curly fry in your regular fries and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey.
Sheldon: April 13, a dark night, indeed.
Amy: So what can I do for you?
Sheldon: Im calling to invite you to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening.
Amy: Really?
Sheldon: Yes. You were kind enough to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark with me. So Id like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series, Little House on the Prairie.
Amy: That sounds lovely. Why are you rubbing your hands together?
Sheldon: Um, Im putting on lotion. Are you in or not?
Amy: Of course Im in.
Sheldon: Excellent. Then I shall see you tomorrow. Good night, Dr. Fowler.
Amy: Good night, Dr. Cooper.
Sheldon: Good night, indeed. What a rube. Why would I put on lotion when I have such soft hands?
Scene: Howard and Bernadettes apartment.
Bernadette: You were really quiet during dinner. Is everything okay?
Howard: Yeah. I guess I was just thinking about my mom, and how sad my childhood was.
Bernadette: Yeah, I bet it sucked. Im gonna take a bath, you do the dishes.
Howard: How about I take a bath with you and see what happens.
Bernadette: Heres whats gonna happen. Im gonna take a bath, and youre gonna do the dishes.
Howard: Thats it? No compassion?
Bernadette: Aw, poor Howie. We good? Im gonna take a bath.
Howard: Bernie
Bernadette: God, what is going on with you? 
Howard: Im sharing my pain.
Bernadette: And Im not buying it. Try again.
Howard: Im learning to be a man in a culture where its increasingly difficult to know how?
Bermadette: Strike two.
Howard: Im copying Leonard. When he does this to Penny, they have sex and watch Monty Python.
Bernadette: Howard.
Howard: I know. It was dumb, I shouldnt have done it. And its making me feel sad. So sad. You know, why dont you take a bath? Ill do the dishes.
Scene: Rajs apartment.
Raj: Three, two, one. 
Stuart: Thats it. Our dating profiles are live on the Internet.
Raj: Attention all shoppers, my business is open for business!
Stuart: Thats right, ladies. For all you know, Im confident and fun to be around.
Raj: Oh, cool, it tells you when someones reading your profile. Jenny309. I hope thats not her weight. 
Stuart: If it is, Ill take her. Ooh, I got one, too. The ladies are coming to us. Oh, man, if Id started this years ago, Id be divorced two or three times by now.
Raj: What? Another one. You know, it, its weird. When theyre reading your profile, does it, does it make you feel exposed? Like they see you naked?
Stuart: Well, theyre not running away screaming, so, no.
Scene: The apartment. 
Amy: I love Little House. It made me want to live on a farm so much I tried to milk my cat. That tangy bowl of Cheerios was not worth the stitches.
Sheldon: Well, you sit back, relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. You see that cabin there? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Yeah. Personally, I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong, but this is your favourite show, not mine. Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter? Huh? Thats strange, since peanut butter wasnt introduced until the early 1900s. If I knew this show was about time travel, I would have watched it much sooner.
Amy: Youre trying to get back at me for what I said about Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Sheldon: Thats silly. Almost as silly as Dr. Baker having a telephone, since telephones only existed in large cities at that time. This is more like Little House on the Preposterous.
Amy: Sheldon, were in a relationship. When you get angry, just tell me. You dont need to seek revenge.
Sheldon: Are you sure? Every time my dad stayed out all night, my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco.
Amy: Well, thats not how were going to do it.
Sheldon: Fine. Im mad at you. Not only did you ruin Raiders for me, you may have ruined the whole franchise. Except for the fourth one, which was bad before you got your mitts on it.
Amy: I shouldnt have said it. Im sorry.
Sheldon: Thank you.
Amy: Do you feel better?
Sheldon: Yes. But not as good as Im going to when I tell you that your precious Garfield has no reason to hate Mondays. Hes a cat. He doesnt have a job.
Scene: Pennys apartment.
Leonard: Hey, I was just what is happening?
Penny: Oh, just a little treat. I know youve been feeling really bad about your mom lately.
Leonard: Oh, oh, I have. So bad.
Penny: And I wanted to make you feel better, so I planned something very special for you.
Leonard: Uh-huh, I can already feel it working.
Mrs Hofstadter (on webcam): Hello, Leonard.
Leonard: Mom?
Mrs Hofstadter: I understand you have been whining about my parenting in order to emotionally manipulate your girlfriend. 
Leonard: I uh
Penny: Bernadette told me everything. Now you dont get the left or the right.
Mrs Hofstadter: Lets discuss why you continue to involve me in your sex life.
Leonard: Oh, please, Mommy. No, Mommy.
Mrs Hofstadter: When you were six years old, you walked in on me and your father naked. I was swatting his bottom with your brand new Ping Pong paddle.
Leonard: I didnt dream that?
Mrs Hofstadter: How did that make you feel?
Leonard: Penny, come back. Im sad for real now.
Scene: Rajs apartment. 
Raj: In the last two hours, 162 women have read our profiles. How many of them have sent us messages?
Stuart: Combined?
Raj: Yes.
Stuart: Zero.
Raj: Dude, this is, this is brutal. 
Stuart: I dont think Ive ever felt so rejected. And I had a rescue dog who ran back to the pound.
Raj: This is the worst. If were gonna get shot down, we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school.
Stuart: And make them look us in the eye.
Raj: Yeah, anything is better than this.
Scene: A bar. 
Raj: Hello.
Girl: Not interested.
Raj: I was wrong. This is worse.
Scene: The apartment. 
Howard: Wait, wait, if it wasnt for Indiana Jones, the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse. 
Sheldon: Thats true. He collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing.
Raj: Like a hero.
All: Yeah!
Leonard: Although, technically, Indy was supposed to take the ark to a museum to be studied. He couldnt even get that done.
All: Aw!
